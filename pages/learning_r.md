# Resources for Learning R

There are many online materials for learning R. Here is just a small sample of free online resources.

## Tutorials and manuals
* [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net) - menu driven tutorials
* [TryR](http://tryr.codeschool.com/) - simple interactive sessions through the web (no R needed on desktop)
* [UsingR.pdf](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/usingR.pdf) - easy to follow manual
* [An Introduction to R](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html) - exhaustive manual

## Packages worth extra exploration
  * [plyr](http://plyr.had.co.nz/) - split data, apply a function to each piece, and combine the results back together
  * [reshape2](http://had.co.nz/reshape/) - melt your data into long format (few columns, many rows) and cast it into wide format (few rows, many columns)
  * [ggplot2](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/) - plotting using the "grammar of graphics" principles ([cookbook](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/))

## Compared to Matlab
* [matlabR.pdf](http://www.math.umaine.edu/~hiebeler/comp/matlabR.pdf) - syntax and function differences
* [R for Matlab Users](http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/octave-r.html) - quick cheat sheet of similar functions
