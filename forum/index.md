This OHI+ Community Forum is a place to share questions and answers during the OHI+ process. It is a venue to connect directly with other groups conducting OHI+ assessments (see [Projects](/projects)).

The [OHI Manual](/manual) contains a lot of instruction based on experiences conducting OHI and OHI+ assessments. The manual will be frequently updated with instruction and troubleshooting advice based on questions and answers posted here.
