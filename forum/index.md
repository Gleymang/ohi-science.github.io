This OHI+ Community Forum is a place to share questions and answers during the OHI+ process. While the [OHI Manual](/manual) is continually updated based on OHI+ groups' experience and troubleshooting tips, The Forum is a place to connect more directly with other groups conducting OHI+ assessments (see [Projects](/projects)).
