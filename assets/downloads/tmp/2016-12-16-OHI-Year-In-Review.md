It can sometimes be difficult to explain what the Ocean Health Index (OHI) project is, because it is so many different things that spin off from a central theme. The Ocean Health Index is a scientific framework that allows marine systems to be scored from 0-100 based on how well they sustainably provide benefits to people. But it is also: 

- software and a workflow that demonstrates transparent, reproducible, and open science
- used to complete global assessments each year - five years and counting - that score 220 coastal nations and territories that incorporate the most up-to-date information available
- used by independent groups to assess ocean health in their jurisdictions to inform policy decisions

The Ocean Health Index framework was developed in 2012 to fill the need...

The framework scores xyz using the best science available, and is flexible to be used in different contexts and spatial scales with a mix of conceptual and practical rules. For example, the Coastal Protection goal scores how well coastal habitats protect the coastline from storms and erosion. But how this is calculated depends on the data available for individual assessments. For example, for the Gulf of Guayaquil assessment in Ecuador, mangrove data were used to model this goal. In Antarctica, sea ice was used. In the Baltic assessment, Coastal Protection was not scored at all, because...
