The Ocean Health Index team is pleased to announce the launch of our redesigned [OHI-Science](http://ohi-science.org/) website! This site details/presents the Github-based, open science of the Ocean Health Index, and provides guides for conducting independent OHI assessments, called **OHI+ assessments**. 

Since the OHI framework was developed in 2012, eleven assessments have been completed at global, national, and regional scales, four of which are OHI+ assessments led by independent academic or government groups. The processes and wisdom of conducting those assessments are recorded on our redesigned website, which gives better access to: 

* [completed and on-going independent OHI+ assessments](/projects)
* [detailed instruction on the four phases of the OHI+ assessment process](/phases)
* [access to data, methods, documentation, and publications)](/resources)
* [a forum of OHI+ community experiences and Q&A](/forum)

Redesigned with a fresh look, [OHI-Science](http://ohi-science.org/) allows visitors to easily navigate through the most up-to-date information on active assessments and methods. It is the sister website to [OceanHealthIndex.org](http://oceanhealthindex.org), which focuses on OHI assessments at the global scale. 

[OHI-Science](http://ohi-science.org/) is a platform for tools used and developed by a very active open science and OHI+ community, and will be updating constantly. To receive updates, please email info at ohi-science.org.

Special Thanks for Lauren Walker, our NCEAS-based designer and coder who gave our website the beautiful new look (facelift?).  

To add: 
- nod to github, maybe 'fork me on github' banner? ning: not sure how a banner would look. would it distract from the homepage image? 
- designed and coded by lauren walker
