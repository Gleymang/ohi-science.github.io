The Ocean Health Index team is proud to announce the launch of our redesigned [**OHI-Science.org**](http://ohi-science.org/) website. [**OHI-Science.org**](http://ohi-science.org/) is the primary source of the Ocean Health Index (OHI)â€™s scientific information and tools and provides instruction for conducting independently led OHI assessments, called OHI+.

Since the OHI framework was developed in 2012 ([Halpern et al., 2012, *Nature*](/resources/publications#global)), eleven assessments have been completed, four of which are OHI+ assessments independently led by academic or government groups. The redesigned website incorporates knowledge and experience gained through these assessments to provide the best possible information and methodology for conducting an OHI+.

As the sister website to [OceanHealthIndex.org](http://oceanhealthindex.org), [**OHI-Science.org**](http://ohi-science.org/) allows visitors to easily access our freely-available data and methods and explore completed and ongoing assessments. New features include easy navigation and access to: 

* [Open-source methods and data products](/resources/tools) 
* [Current OHI and OHI+ assessments](/projects)
* [Instruction for the OHI+ assessment process](/phases)
* [OHI publications and documentation](/resources/publications)
* [OHI+ community forum](/forum)

[**OHI-Science.org**](http://ohi-science.org/) is a platform for tools used and developed by a very active open science and OHI+ community, and will be updating constantly. To receive updates, please email info@ohi-science.org or follow us on Twitter: @ohiscience. 


*This website is hosted by GitHub. Many thanks to Lauren Walker, an NCEAS-based designer and coder who redesigned our website with its beautiful new look.*
