The Ocean Health Index team is pleased to announce the launch of our redesigned [OHI-Science](http://ohi-science.org/) website! This site is for visitors interested in the science of the Ocean Health Index or in conducting their own independent OHI assessments, called **OHI+ assessments**. Redesigned with a fresh look, [OHI-Science](http://ohi-science.org/) allows visitors to easily navigate to find the most up-to-date information. It is the sister website to [OceanHealthIndex.org](http://oceanhealthindex.org), which focuses on OHI assessments at the global scale.

Since the OHI framework was developed in 2012, eleven assessments have been completed at global, national, and regional scales, four of which are OHI+ assessments led by independent academic or government groups. The redesigned website gives better access to:

* [completed and on-going independent OHI+ assessments](/projects)
* [detailed instruction on the four phases of the OHI+ assessment process](/phases)
* [access to data, methods, documentation, and publications)](/resources)
* [a forum of OHI+ community experiences and Q&A](/forum)

[OHI-Science](http://ohi-science.org/) is a platform for tools used and developed by a very active open science and OHI+ community, and will be updating constantly. To receive updates, please email info at ohi-science.org.
