**Today the Ocean Health Index (OHI) announces the completion of the fifth annual global Ocean Health Index (OHI) assessment** at the 17th annual Global Environment Facility Large Marine Ecosystem meeting in Paris. Global OHI scores represent ocean health for 220 coastal nations and territories and are calculated with the same methods and best available information each year. The OHI, established in 2012, is a partnership led by scientists from the National Center for Ecological Synthesis and Analysis (NCEAS) at the University of California at Santa Barbara and Conservation International.

**The average 2016 Index score was 71 out of 100**. Average Index scores have not dramatically changed over five years, which could be expected at a global scale. However, some individual goals and regions have had significant changes.
