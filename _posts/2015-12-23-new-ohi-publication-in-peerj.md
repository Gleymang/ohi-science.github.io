We are proud to announce our new publication [**'Best practices for assessing ocean health in multiple contexts using tailorable frameworks'**]() in the open-access online peer-reviewed journal [PeerJ](https://peerj.com/). From our experience leading and supporting eleven completed assessments, we discuss how the Ocean Health Index framework can be tailored for use in different contexts and identify four best practices for conducting assessments using any integrated framework. The best practices are general enough to be used in any assessment process, but are also accompanied by specific guidance and examples from assessments using the Ocean Health Index framework: 

- Incorporate key characteristics and priorities into the assessment framework design before gathering information
- Strategically define spatial boundaries to balance information availability and decision-making scales
- Maintain the key characteristics and priorities of the assessment framework regardless of information limitations
- Document and share the assessment process, methods, and tools

In addition to the best practices, we stress that the process of conducting assessments can be as valuable as the final results, and that any assessment process must be *transparent* about which decisions were made and why, *reproducible* through access to detailed methods and computational code, *repeatable* via the ability to modify methods and computational code, and *easily communicated* to wide audiences. When assessments can easily build from past approaches, the more time and resources can be directed towards management action.
