More news from the OHI team â€” we have been busy!  

We have **restructured [ohi-science.org](http://ohi-science.org)** a bit, now that it's been over a year since its first launch. We now have Global assessments, the OHI process, and all OHI assessments under the [Projects](/projects) page. We've also added new features on the [Resources](/resources) page, including the [Data](/data) we use in global assessments, and [Training](/training) materials that are available even as they are developed. You can also navigate to the [Forum](/forum) from the Resources tab. Check it out!  

**Steve Katona led a paper** that has been published by OpenChannels: [
Navigating the seascape of ocean management: waypoints on the voyage toward sustainable use](https://www.openchannels.org/literature/16817). OpenChannels also published a short article about it: [EBM Toolbox: A new, short, and free primer on modern ocean management](https://meam.openchannels.org/news/meam/ebm-toolbox-new-short-and-free-primer-modern-ocean-management). Full citation: *Katona, S.K., J. Polsenberg, J.S.S. Lowndes et al. 2017. Navigating the seascape of ocean management: waypoints on the voyage toward sustainable use. OpenChannels: Forum for Ocean Planning and Management. 44 pp.*

**We gave a webinar on Open Channels: Transforming how we approach marine science for management**. Julie Lowndes and Erich Pacheco focused on how using open data science practices and tools have played a huge role in the OHI project growing into what it is today, with 20 countries around the world building directly off our science and our code.
