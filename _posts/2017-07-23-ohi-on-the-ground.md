We are often asked for examples of the Ocean Health Index being used for coastal management 'on the ground'. Since the OHI framework was published in 2012, there are about twenty OHI assessments being developed around the world, many of which are  independently-led (called OHI+) by governments, academics, and NGOs. Independent assessments tailor the OHI framework to represent the priorities of the area being assessed, building from the science and computational code developed in previous assessments. For more information, see our publication in *PeerJ* [Best practices for assessing ocean health in multiple contexts using tailorable frameworks](https://peerj.com/articles/1503/) and a map all OHI assessments [here](http://ohi-science.org/projects/ohi-assessments/).

Here are a few examples of how OHI assessments are being completed and used for coastal marine management around the world. 

## Motivation for leading OHI assessments

## OHI in formal management commitments

## How long do assessments take?

I tend to think about how long assessments take from a science perspective: the Conduct phase. (Sidenote: we think about OHI assessments in four phases: Learn, Plan, Conduct, and Inform. More often than not, these phases overlap in time, but it is still useful to think about them like this when we talk about how long assessments take). I measure this from the time teams start outlining the goals they will measure and gathering the data they will use. This is generally around the time groups start using the Toolbox. The Conduct phase has taken as little as 9 months and as long as XX years. This range depends a lot on the scope of the assessment and the team itself. For the scope of the assessment: how many goal models need to be redefined, how much local data will be used, and how easily it's accessible, and how much it needs to be processed. Data gathering and model development can require a lot of back-and-forth:  For the team: how many teammembers there are, how closely they work together, and how easily they pick up the OHI Toolbox workflow. The Toolbox uses a lot of emerging best practices from data science and are likely things that not everyone has experience with already. However, things that we've seen to speed assessments along is having more than one team-member who are experienced in R, and are comfortable learning new systems, including collaborative coding with GitHub.
One thing we've found that it *doesn't* depend on the number of regions assessed. 

We talk about this quite a bit in our publication in PeerJ ["Best practices for assessing ocean health in multiple contexts using tailorable frameworks"](https://peerj.com/articles/1503/). 

Gearing up to do an assessment is in the Plan phase; we have seen this take up to 

This depends on a lot of things, but primarily the scope of the assessment (i.e. how many goals will be changed, how much local data will be included), and how big the team is, experience with R...

## Global 
- Since 2012, we have repeated Global assessments annually, and they are being considered as an indicator for the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 14: Life Below Water

## Colombia
- Since 2012, Colombia has been preparing for a national-scale assessment, and has focused on creating a national database for OHI-related information and establishing channels for different government ministries to share data

## China
- In 2015, China finished its first national assessment of 11 coastal provinces and is now preparing for assessments at smaller municipal scales

## Ecuador
- In 2015, Ecuador completed its assessment of the Gulf of Guayaquil and is now preparing for a national-scale assessment that would include the Galapagos

## New Caledonia
- In 2016, New Caledonia completed a pilot study and is preparing to use OHI for monitoring, assessment, and active management of its 1.3 million square kilometer marine park

## Baltic Sea
- In 2017, the Baltic Sea will be completing the first trans-boundary assessment of eight countries, with plans to repeat subsequent assessments of the same area and improve methods

## British Columbia, Canada
- The OHI team is working with local partners to track change in the health of British Columbiaâ€™s ocean during the past ten years and to describe how management may have contributed to these patterns

## Northeastern USA
- The OHI team is working with partners in the Northeastern United States to track the health of coastal oceans, and the assessment is included in the USA's first-ever National Ocean Plan
