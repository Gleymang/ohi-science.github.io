**Description**: The OHI is being used as a tool for monitoring and evaluation in the US Northeast Ocean Plan, finalized by the National Ocean Council on December 7, 2016. Working with local partners, we will adapt the Index to capture priorities for ocean health in the Northeast. Our approach will incorporate locally meaningful information and perspectives in order to track change in the health of the ocean. The OHI will also be applied over the past ten years to examine changes in regional ocean health to better understand how management may have contributed to these patterns.
