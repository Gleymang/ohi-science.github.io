**Description**: The Hawaii Ocean Health Index is integrating economic, social, and ecological information to track the sustainable use of our ocean resources.  This assessment will increase awareness on  the activities that are being done across the state that support the sustainable use of our ocean resources and identify remaining knowledge gaps and priorities. With this information we we will catalyze stakeholder involvement across sectors and facilitate collaborations to ensure the health of our ocean now and into the future.
