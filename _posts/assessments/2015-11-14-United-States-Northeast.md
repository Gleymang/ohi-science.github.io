**Status**: Active  
**Leading group**: National Center for Ecological Assessment and Synthesis at UC Santa Barbara  
**Contact**: Dr. Ben Halpern (halpern @ bren.ucsb.edu)  
**Description**: Working with local partners over the next two years, we will adapt the Ocean Health Index to capture characteristics that make the Northeast's coastal ecosystems unique. Our approach will incorporate locally meaningful information, priorities, and perspectives in order to track change in the health of the ocean during the past ten years and to describe how management may have contributed to these patterns.
