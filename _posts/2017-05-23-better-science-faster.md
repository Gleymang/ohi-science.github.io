We have a Perspective published today in *Nature Ecology & Evolution* — and it's open access!

The title is "Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools". it's about how we learned the hard way that the way we were working with data wasn’t efficient to reproduce our own work, but now we use software tools that Silicon Valley uses to accelerate collaboration and work deliberately with data. We've made a website to help you to do better science in less time too:  [ohi-science.org/betterscienceinlesstime](http://ohi-science.org/betterscienceinlesstime)

It’s been game-changing for our science and how it is used for management. 

We’re sharing our story to try to inspire others to use better practices and tools too. We don’t have time to stick to our old ways when we could all be so much more effective. 

We want others to see themselves in this future and become a part of it. 

We are using the same tools that make Silicon Valley so innovative, which means we’ve embraced collaborative coding and data science. 

Coding and version control are things you may have heard of. Coding lets you create a reusable record of the analyses you’ve done, and version control takes care of all the bookkeeping that you’d otherwise do, like model_v1.R and model_v1b.R. This is super powerful.
