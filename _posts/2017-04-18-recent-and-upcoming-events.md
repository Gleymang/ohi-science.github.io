<!---Hi Ning! This looks great. I made some edits and comments too. One thing I remembered is that the website doesn't display bullet points very nicely, so would you want to change these into more paragraph form (really only will change the Annual Report section), and maybe **bold** the first few words that tell what each paragraph are about?

Hello OHI supporters! We haven't reached out to you for a while but we haven't been idle! Here let us update you with a few of our most recent activities: 

- **The OHI 2016 Annual Report** has been published! OHI is five years old now, and is being used for assessment and management in more than 20 countries. The full report is available to [download](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-science.github.io/raw/master/assets/downloads/other/2016_Annual_report_compressed.pdf), but here are some highlights from 2016: 

  - With the addition of Africa, on-going, independently-led assessments (OHI+) are being implemented across all inhabited continents. 
  - Mexico publicly committed to using the OHI as the structure for the national Interdepartmental Commission for Sustainable Management of Seas and Coasts.

<!--- 
I removed SDGs since we talk about them below, is there another example you'd want to add here instead or do you think 2 are enough? And let's make it a paragraph instead of bullets

Also, I deleted the annual report cover because it looked like too much with all the photos I think

- Lead OHI scientists Steve Katona and Ben Halpern gave a webinar on Open Channels titled: _[Drivers and implications of change in global ocean health](https://www.openchannels.org/webinars/2017/drivers-and-implications-change-global-ocean-health-demonstrated-ocean-health-index)_ discussing the changes in OHI scores over five years (2012-2016), possible causes and consequences of those changes, challenges and opportunities for composite indicators to incorporate the best available science each year, and lessons learned in repeating and improving the OHI assessment each year.

- OHI was featured in Samoa's national newspaper, the _Somoa Observer_ in April this year: [Conservation International highlights oceans in Samoa](http://www.samoaobserver.ws/en/06_04_2017/local/18722/Conservation-International-highlights-oceans-in-Samoa.htm). OHI program manager Erich Pacheco went to Samoa to conduct a national workshop in partnership with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment and in close collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. Since Samoa is a very influential country amongst the South Pacific island nations, commitment from Samoa will pave the way to more engagements with other Pacific countries. Our hope is to partner with governments and other stakeholders in the region to align ocean and coastal management strategies at all scales of management. <!---can you also link to Cherelle's blog/facebook?, and maybe cut this down by a sentence?--->

**Coming up soon**

- SDGs coming up: the OHI is expected to be an indicator for the The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14: Life Below Water.

<!---(should we say more about it than what was mentioned above? i couldn't find official releases on this topic...) 
Julie: I removed it from above, let's just have it here. I changed the wording to what Johanna and Steve OK'd a few months ago, I never know how to talk about this because as you say there's no documentation! --->

- We have a new paper coming out in *Nature Ecology & Evolution* next month! It is about how we dramatically improved the way we do our science by embracing data science and open science. We discuss how this has powered our work with the OHI, since OHI+ groups around the world are able to build off our science and code. We hope by sharing our story we will encourage more groups to embrace open and collaborative practices in their own science for management.
   
<!--- 
 -> umm... can we mention the title and Nature at least? otherwise I think it's too vague to write here... 
 
I cut it a bit, I think let's just keep it short like this. 

- other?
