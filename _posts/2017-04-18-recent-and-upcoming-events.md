Hello OHI supporters! We haven't reached out to you for a while but we haven't been idle! Here let us update you with a few of our most recent activities: 

- [OHI 2016 Annual Report](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-science.github.io/raw/master/assets/downloads/other/2016_Annual_report_compressed.pdf) has been published. OHI is five-years old now, and is being adopted in more than 20 countries. Here are some highlights from 2016: 

  - With the addition of Africa, on-going, independently-led assessments (OHI+) are being implemented across all inhabited continents. 
  - The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14: Life Below Water proposed the OHI as an implementation mechanism.
  - Mexico publicly committed to using the OHI as the structure for the national Interdepartmental Commission for Sustainable Management of Seas and Coasts.

- Lead OHI scientists Steve Katona and Ben Halpern gave a webinar on Open Channels titled: _[Drivers and Implications of change in global ocean health](https://www.openchannels.org/webinars/2017/drivers-and-implications-change-global-ocean-health-demonstrated-ocean-health-index)_ discussing the changes in OHI scores over five years (2012-2016), possible causes and consequences of those changes, challenges and opportunities for composite indicators to incorporate the best available science each year, and lessons learned in repeating and improving the OHI assessment each year.

- OHI was featured in Samoa's national newspaper, the _Somoa Observer_ in April this year: [onservation International highlights oceans in Samoa](http://www.samoaobserver.ws/en/06_04_2017/local/18722/Conservation-International-highlights-oceans-in-Samoa.htm). OHI program manager went to Samoa to conduct a national workshop in partnership with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment and in close collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. Since Samoa is a very influencial country amongst the South Pacific island nations, commitment from Samoa will pave the way to more engagments with other Pacific countries. Our hope is to partner with governments and other stakeholders in the region to align ocean and coastal management strategies at all scales of management. 

**Coming up soon**

- SDGs coming up: The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14: Life Below Water proposed the OHI as an implementation mechanism. (should we say more about it than what was mentioned above? i couldn't find official releases on this topic...) 

- A new paper on OHI science is coming out in Nature next month. The article is about how we dramatically improved the way we work by embracing data science and open science. We describe how we transitioned to coding collaboratively, sharing our work online, and communicating from our same workflow by building websites using free software tools. We provide specific examples through our experiences with the Ocean Health Index, including supporting 20 governments around the world that are building off our science and code. The intention is that by sharing our story we will encourage more environmental scientists to embrace open and collaborative practices, and we are committed to continued training through OHI. 
   
 -> umm... can we mention the title and Nature at least? otherwise I think it's too vague to write here... 

- other?
