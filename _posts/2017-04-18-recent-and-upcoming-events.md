Intro (we've been busy...)

Paragraph about each of these:

- MEAM webinar Steve Katona and Ben Halpern
[](https://www.openchannels.org/webinars/2017/drivers-and-implications-change-global-ocean-health-demonstrated-ocean-health-index) (screenshot of the title page)

    -teaser about upcoming one

- Samoa, link to Cherelle's blog

- SDGs coming up

- paper coming out (has to be vague, let's not give a date or even say the journal)?

   - The article is about how we dramatically improved the way we work by embracing data science and open science. We describe how we transitioned to coding collaboratively, sharing our work online, and communicating from our same workflow by building websites using free software tools. We provide specific examples through our experiences with the Ocean Health Index, including supporting 20 governments around the world that are building off our science and code. The intention is that by sharing our story we will encourage more environmental scientists to embrace open and collaborative practices, and we are committed to continued training through OHI.
