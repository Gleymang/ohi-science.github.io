Conducting an Ocean Health Index assessment requires collaborative coding in `R`, and we are often asked for the best way to learn `R` as well as other data science concepts and tools. There are many great resources available but here are some of the free, online resources we have found helpful: 

- **[R for data science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)** by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund (book)
- **[RStudio's webinars](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/)** by RStudio (on-demand videos)
- **[RStudio's cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)** by RStudio (PDFs)
- **[R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/)** by Hadley Wickham (book)
- **[Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/)** by Hadley Wickham (book)

- **[UBC Stats545: Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R](https://stat545-ubc.github.io/index.html)** by Jenny Bryan (university course)
- **[Swirl](http://swirlstats.com/)** (interactive course taught in R)
- **[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/)** (workshops, teaching community, self-paced courses)
