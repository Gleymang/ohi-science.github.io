- software tools developed for calculating OHI scores that demonstrates transparent, reproducible, and open science. 
- used to complete annual global assessments - five years and counting - that represent ocean health for 220 coastal nations and territories that incorporate the most up-to-date information available.

The Ocean Health Index framework was developed in 2012 to fill the need...

The framework scores xyz using the best science available, and is flexible to be used in different contexts and spatial scales with a mix of conceptual and practical rules. For example, the Coastal Protection goal scores how well coastal habitats protect the coastline from storms and erosion. But how this is calculated depends on the data available for individual assessments. For example, for the Gulf of Guayaquil assessment in Ecuador, mangrove data were used to model this goal. In Antarctica, sea ice was used. In the Baltic assessment, Coastal Protection was not scored at all, because...
