The Ocean Health Index practices and promotes open science, data science, and team science in marine science and policy. We do this by using software tools that make our work transparent, reproducible, and shared publicly online. 

These concepts are getting more visibility in blogs and the news, but also in the academic literature. The journal *Nature* even has a [Toolbox series](http://www.nature.com/news/toolbox) where they discuss software tools and approaches. We have started this list of references on these topics, along with a quote from the article to give a sense of its content. This list is unfortunately not comprehensive; please suggest additions through the [OHI forum](http://ohi-science.org/forum/) or twitter at [`@OHIScience`](https://twitter.com/ohiscience), or as a [pull request].

    - *"Over the past four years, we have studied more than a dozen scientific consortia involved in data sharing, and we've mapped the landscape of these and another such initiatives. When they work well, consortia act as catalysts, to accomplish what members cannot do alone. But scientists are seldom taught effective strategies to design and manage such coalitions. Here we distil the lessons from our fieldwork into five ways to foster open science."*

    - *"The spreadsheet software Microsoft Excel, when used with default settings, is known to convert gene names to dates and floating-point numbers.
