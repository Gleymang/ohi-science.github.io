How is the Ocean Health Index being used by different groups around the world? There are currently about twenty OHI assessments being developed around the world, many of which are independently-led (called OHI+) by governments, academics, and NGOs. The OHI framework is tailored to represent the priorities of the area being assessed, building from the science and analytical code developed in previous assessments. For more information, see our publication in *PeerJ* [Best practices for assessing ocean health in multiple contexts using tailorable frameworks](https://peerj.com/articles/1503/) and a [map of all OHI assessments](http://ohi-science.org/projects/ohi-assessments/). 

Here are some examples of OHI "on the ground".

## Why do groups lead independent OHI assessments?

When the OHI was first released in 2012, Colombia began efforts to lead their own assessment to establish a baseline to help guide national ocean policy. New Caldedonia's government plans to use OHI as a monitoring tool for their new 1.3 million square kilometer marine park. Scientists in the Baltic Sea want to see if OHI is the right tool to assess Marine Stategy Framework Directives in the European Union. And assessments in British Columbia and the Northeastern United States aim to see if management initiatives in the past ten years are reflected in OHI scores.


## How is OHI being used for management?

Mexico and Indonesia have formal management commitments in place as they begin planning their OHI assessments. OHI is included in the first US Ocean Plan in the Northeastern US. In Colombia, efforts to inventory available information have led to developing a central data repository and standardized monitoring program before beginning assessment planning. Groups in Ecuador, New Caledonia, Canada, and China have completed OHI pilot studies (either at small spatial scales or only tailoring a few goals) and are now planning additional assessments. Finally, global OHI assessments are expected to be an indicator for the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 14: Life Below Water. 


## How has OHI been received by stakeholder groups?

Working openly throughout data collection, processing, and model development has helped some stakeholders feel more comfortable with the OHI process. Describing the motivation behind which data were excluded on OHI project websites has been as important for the motivation behind which data were included and how models were developed. Some groups, including in [the Baltic](http://ohi-science.org/bhi/goals.html), have also listed what improvements could be addressed in future assessments.

## Any cool new science?

Goal weighting: Scientists in Canada did a nation-wide survey to explore preferences throughout Canada. They found that the Clean Waters goal is highly important for all Canadians, and that a majority (83%) of Canadians favoured non-extractive over extractive benefits. The importance of other benefits like Food Provision and Biodiversity varied with respondent age, political affiliation, and/or seafood-eating frequency.
