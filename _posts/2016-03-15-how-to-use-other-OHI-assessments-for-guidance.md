As the Ocean Health Index is an open-science tool used by inspired scientists and researchers all over the world, we can all benefit from the collective wisdom of an amazing OHI+ community. [**ohi-science.org**](http://ohi-science.org/) aims to facilitate sharing between OHI+ experiences. Here are a few tips on how to learn from and connect with other OHI+ groups: 

- [OHI-Assessments](http://ohi-science.org/projects/ohi-assessments) page, where you can view all the OHI and OHI+ assessments. Click the map or scroll down to see information for each country, and then you can explore their data repository, documentation, publications, or websites, which are available depending on where they are in the project. The repositories will be especially helpful for technical experts to share code. 
    - ***Pro tip 1:*** Each assessment repository has a folder structure like yours, and within the scenario folder (which could have a different name, like region2016), all the file architecture is the same. This means you can find the `conf/functions.R` file and see what code looks like for other assessments, and build off of it! Each will also have a prep folder.
    - ***Pro tip 2:*** Each assessment repository will also have an accompanying website where this information is communicated to broad audiences, and could be useful to you as well.

- [Goals](http://ohi-science.org/goals/) page, where you would find a method comparison table for each goal that summarized all the completed studies, including their goal model approach, reference point, and other considerations. 

- [Forum](http://ohi-science.org/forum/), where OHI+ practitioners connect and communicate directly. You can ask and answer conceptual and technical questions emerging from an OHI+ project. 

- [Publications](http://ohi-science.org/publications/) page, where we list published work and documentation for OHI assessments.

- [@OHIScience on Twitter](https://twitter.com/OHIscience)! We tweet about OHI news, announce technical blog posts and share coding tips. Follow us to join the OHI+ community!
