Our redesigned ohi-science.org has incorporated all the guides and resources our team offers. So many new pages and features might seem a bit overwhelming. Here is a quick guide on how to find the resources you need to start your own OHI+ assessment. 

- [Manual](http://ohi-science.org/manual/). The Conduct Phase Manual offers information from how to conceptually think about what goals to include and how to set up spatial boundaries, to technical step-by-step guide on how to use the toolbox to calculate a goal score. It also includes frequently asked quesitons, R troubleshooting examples, and templates on data reporting in the Appendixes. 

- [Goals](http://ohi-science.org/goals/) page. Introducing the philosophy, ideal approaches, practical guidance, and a methods comparison table that include approaches from completed OHI assessments for each goal. 

- The [Forum](http://ohi-science.org/forum/). The forum is just github issues, which are a way to open a topic and have others discuss it and share solutions. Although the OHI team will help answer questions, the forum is a place for OHI+ groups across the world to interact, so please contribute. Forum issues will also be incorporated into the manual

- [Other OHI+ projects](http://ohi-science.org/projects/). This is a place to see all OHI+ projects, including their github repositories, publications, WebApps, etc. 

- R error messages. If you encounter an error message not included in the Manual, check the forum, or google the whole error message. Look for responses from StackOverflow or github where people encounter and troubleshoot the same errors you have seen.
