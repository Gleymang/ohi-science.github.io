How is the Ocean Health Index being used by different groups around the world? There are about twenty OHI assessments that are completed or ongoing, many of which are independently-led by governments, academics, and NGOs. Wherever OHI assessments occur, the OHI framework is tailored to represent the priorities of the area, building from the science and analytical code developed in previous assessments, and also from communication and management approaches. Here are some examples of OHI in a management context.

## Why do groups lead independent OHI assessments?

When the OHI was first published in 2012, Colombia began efforts to lead their own OHI assessment to establish a baseline for guiding national ocean policy. New Caledonia's government plans to use OHI as a monitoring tool for their new 1.3 million square kilometer marine park. Scientists in the Baltic Sea want to see if OHI is the right tool to assess Marine Strategy Framework Directives in the European Union. And assessments in British Columbia and the Northeastern United States aim to see if management initiatives in the past ten years are reflected in OHI scores.


## How is OHI being used for management?

Mexico and Indonesia set up formal management commitments before beginning their OHI assessments. OHI is included in the first US Ocean Plan in the Northeastern United States. In Colombia, the OHI framework is being used to create a central data repository and standardized monitoring program before the assessment begins. Groups in Ecuador, New Caledonia, Canada, and China have completed OHI pilot studies (either at small spatial scales or only tailoring a few goals) and are now planning additional assessments. Finally, global OHI assessments are expected to be an indicator for the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 14: Life Below Water. 


## How has OHI been received by stakeholder groups?

Working openly throughout data collection, processing, and model development has helped some stakeholders feel more comfortable with the OHI process. Describing the motivation behind which data were excluded on OHI project websites has been as important for the motivation behind which data were included and how models were developed. Some groups, including in [the Baltic](http://ohi-science.org/bhi/goals.html), have also listed what improvements could be addressed in future assessments.

## Any cool new science?

One cool thing is about goal weighting: Scientists in Canada did a nation-wide survey to explore preferences throughout Canada [(Daigle *et al*. 2016)](http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0308597X16303323). They found that the Clean Waters goal is highly important for all Canadians, and that a majority (83%) of Canadians favored non-extractive over extractive benefits. The importance of other benefits like Food Provision and Biodiversity varied with respondent age, political affiliation, and/or seafood-eating frequency.
