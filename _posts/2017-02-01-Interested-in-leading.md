*If you're interested in learning more about OHI or leading your own OHI+ assessment, you are in the right place: [ohi-science.org](http://ohi-science.org/) has the information you need. It is the technical website accompanying [oceanhealthindex.org](http://oceanhealthindex.org/). Here are some suggestions for getting started.*

<br>

There are four phases of an OHI assessment: Learn, Plan, Conduct, and Inform. Read about the [OHI+ Phases](http://ohi-science.org/phases/) to help guide you. You can also download the [OHI+ FactSheet](http://ohi-science.org/resources/downloads/).

<br>

We would also recommend reading [***"Best practices for assessing ocean health in multiple contexts using tailorable frameworks"***](https://peerj.com/articles/1503/) and exploring other [publications](http://ohi-science.org/resources/publications/) and [ongoing assessments](http://ohi-science.org/projects/).
