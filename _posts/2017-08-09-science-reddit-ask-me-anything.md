Today, OHI's Dr. Ben Halpern led a [live 'Ask Me Anything' question and answer session on Reddit hosted by PLOS ONE](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/6sl6d6/plos_science_wednesday_hi_reddit_im_ben_halpern/?st=J655GVG8&sh=bc19b19c). 

Ben was discussing our recent publication in PLOS ONE titled [Drivers and implications of change in global ocean health in the past five years](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0178267&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=ama&utm_campaign=redditama-0809). In this paper we report five years of annual assessment of the health of the ocean in all 220 coastal countries and territories around the world, tracking how 10 different broad goals are doing and what is driving changes in those goals. Most notably we found that many countries have improved their overall score by substantially increasing the amount of marine protected areas, while many other countries have seen scores decline due to unsustainable management of fisheries and other ocean resources.

Check out all the great questions and Ben's responses archived [here](https://www.thewinnower.com/papers/7544-plos-science-wednesday-hi-reddit-i-m-ben-halpern-and-my-plos-one-study-investigates-the-health-of-the-ocean-of-220-coastal-countries-and-territories-worldwide-ask-me-anything).
