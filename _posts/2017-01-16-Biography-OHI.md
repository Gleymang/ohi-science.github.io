*2017 marks five years since the OHI first launched and we wanted to reflect on its acheivements with this short biography.*

The Ocean Health Index (OHI) is a scientific method and tool for channeling the best scientific information into marine policy. 
First published in 2012 in the scientific journal *Nature*, it is now used in governmental-management-academic collaborations around the world. 
Global assessments have been [endorsed by the World Economic Forum](http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/news/World_Economic_Forum_Endorses_Ocean_Health_Index), [praised by the Prince of Wales](http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/news/Colobian_Leadership_on_Oceans), [used as an indicator by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity](https://www.bipindicators.net/indicators/ocean-health-index) and expected to be an indicator for parts of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. 
OHI has also been included in United States policy to evaluate ecosystem health as part of the nation's [first Ocean Plan in the Northeast Region](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/12/07/nations-first-ocean-plans), and independently-led assessments are ongoing [in over twenty areas](http://ohi-science.org/projects) including Canada, the Baltic Sea, Ecuador, Israel, China, Colombia, Hawaii, and New Caledonia.

Keys to its achievement thus far include its inclusiveness - bringing people, teams, and data together - and its flexibility and transparency.


The OHI team is a unique academic-nonprofit collaboration between the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) and Conservation International that continues to push boundaries in collaborative management and scientific contexts. Combining our strengths, we bridge science and policy stakeholders through OHI assessments with the ultimate goal of all oceans sustainably providing a range of benefits to people now and in the future.

The OHI is a useful method for policy in many geographic scales because it has a standard structure that is familiar across assessments but also flexibility as to what is included in any assessment area. 
This flexibility enables OHI to reflect important social and ecological characteristics, values, and priorities of the area assessed.
Independent groups are able to lead assessments within their own waters, deciding what is important to measure and which data to use, but building directly from other OHI assessments instead of reinventing the wheel. 
Using the OHI framework to think critically about what is important in different contexts facilitates holistic assessments of human-ocean systems. 
For example, how well the coastline is protected from storm damage was measured with mangroves in Ecuador, sand dunes in Israel, and not at all in Sweden. 

Healthy oceans doesn't just mean clean water, lots of fish, and happy whales. 
It also means catching fish, watching whales, developing renewable energy, and many other activities that provide jobs and revenue for coastal communities, with all being done sustainably so that future benefits are not compromised.
OHI evaluates those and many other things in an integrated way, by comparing their status against sustainable targets, the pressures acting upon them (such as pollution and invasive species), management action to increase resilience to these pressures, and the interactions between them all.

The OHI has [pledged a commitment at the Our Ocean Conference](http://ourocean2016.org/commitments/#commitments-main) to provide the technical tools and assistance needed by governments and coastal resource managers to help measure and manage ocean health within their jurisdictions. 
We do this by openly sharing all our instruction and methods (including data and code) online at [ohi-science.org](http://ohi-science.org), using the same tools that software developers in Silicon Valley use for working efficiently and collaboratively with data. 
Environmental science demands transparency and repeatability to increase scientific rigor, strengthen public trust, and enhance how science can inform policy, and we continue to be visible leaders in working openly and collaboratively. 

In 2017 we will continue to work for healthy oceans, continue to push boundaries for collaborative science and policy, and look forward to working with an ever-expanding network of ocean leaders.

*The Ocean Health Index was developed from 2009-2012 to fill the need for a quantifiable and easily communicated method to define, measure, and evaluate ‘ocean health’. The Halpern et al. 2012 publication presented both the scientific framework and the first assessment at the global scale. This was quickly followed by assessments at smaller scales with differing data availability and spatial scales in Fiji and the US West Coast, and improvements to several global models (Halpern et al. 2015). [2016 marks the fifth year of annual global assessments](http://ohi-science.org/ohi-global), with scores representing ocean health for 220 coastal nations and territories using the best available data each year.*
