*2017 marks five years of the Ocean Health Index and we wanted to reflect on what its has acheived with this short biography.*

The Ocean Health Index (OHI) is a scientific method and tool for channeling the best scientific information into marine policy. 
Since 2012 it has evolved from a publication in the scientific journal *Nature* to dynamic use in governmental-management-academic collaborations around the world. 
Keys to its success thus far include its inclusiveness - bringing people, teams, and data together - and its flexibility and transparency. 

The ultimate success of the OHI is yet to be seen: it is for all oceans to sustainably provide benefits to people now and in the future. 
Still, there have been important steps through political endorsement and scientific achievement, including being endorsed by the World Economic Forum, praised by the Prince of Wales, and included in United States policy to evaluate ecosystem health as part of the nation's first Ocean Plan in the Northeast Region. 


OHI is a useful method for policy at international, national, and sub-national scales because it has a standard structure that is familiar across assessments but flexiblility the information that is included. This flexibility enables OHI to reflect important social and ecological characteristics and priorities of any region. An analogy would be that OHI is blueprints to a house, but the materials you use will reflect  For example, CS habitat types

The OHI is a unique academic-nonprofit partnership between the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis at UCSB and Conservation International. Leveraging the 

What sets OHI apart is openness. Returning to the blueprint analogy, that blueprint isn't on paper, it's online and you can modify it directly using software developed to be collaborative and transparent. You have similar data to Ecuador? Let's build directly from their work instead of reinventing the wheel. 

In the global arena, the OHI has been endorsed by the World Economic Forum, incorporated into the United Nation’s World Ocean Assessment, chosen as an indicator for Aichi Target 14 of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity and is expected to be an indicator for parts of Target 14 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals for 2030.
In the United States, it will be used 
Colombia
China
South Korea
New Caledonia

~~Several governments have begun using the OHI as a marine planning tool even before scores have been calculated because tailoring the OHI framework initiated an inventory of any existing information and knowledge that could be useful for the assessment. Because such information spans disciplines, space and time, such an inventory can itself guide policy through an understanding of the current policy, information and knowledge landscape. For example, governments in China and Colombia have initiated efforts to improve data availability and standardization of data collection and interpretation for use in OHI+ assessments. In these countries, assessments will be incorporated directly into local planning and scores will be used to inform priorities for marine management. These programs have been government-initiated, and have developed at different rates. For example, China has completed its first national assessment and is planning to conduct repeated assessments at smaller spatial scales while simultaneously creating monitoring programs based on information gaps highlighted from the first assessment. Meanwhile, Colombia has developed a multi-year assessment plan and has prepared an inventory of all marine-related information and has formed a multi-sectorial collaboration to standardize meta-data in preparation for conducting their first national assessment.

The OHI has [pledged a commitment at the Our Ocean Conference](http://ourocean2016.org/commitments/#commitments-main) to provide the technical tools and assistance needed by countries and marine and coastal resource managers to help measure and manage ocean health at local, national and regional scales, and it does so by leading data science stuff...

OHI+
·         Individual regions—including the Arctic, the Baltic Sea (7 nations), British Columbia, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Ecuador, Hawaii, Israel, Mexico, New Caledonia, Peru and South Korea--- are using OHI as a management tool to  improve the health of their own waters.  (Note: check whether the number 7 is correct for Baltic Sea study).
Most importantly, individual nations are beginning to use this Index as a management tool for improving the health of their own waters. Such efforts have been completed or are underway in Arctic, the Baltic Sea (7 nations), British Columbia, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Ecuador, Hawaii, Israel, Mexico, New Caledonia, Peru and South Korea, among others.

> "Ocean Health Index, has proved to be such an important tool in focusing attention to the status of global ocean health, and in quantifying the quality of our natural capital." - [His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales](http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/news/Colobian_Leadership_on_Oceans)

It is a tool for channeling science into marine policy, is a leader for transparent open science, is comparable, 

But what *is* it? The OHI is a scientific framework that allows marine systems to be scored from 0-100 based on how well they sustainably provide benefits to people. But it is also: 

- software and a workflow that demonstrates transparent, reproducible, and open science
- used to complete global assessments each year - five years and counting - that score 220 coastal nations and territories that incorporate the most up-to-date information available
- used by independent groups to assess ocean health in their jurisdictions to inform policy decisions

Data science stuff, OHI+ survey


This year we have seen 


The OHI framework was developed from 2009-2012 by an interdisciplinary team of marine and social scientists and economists to fill the need.... The 2012 publication "An Index..." presented both the scientific framework and the first assessment at the global scale. This was quickly followed by assessments at smaller scales with differing data availability and spatial scales in Fiji and the US West Coast. 2016 marks the fifth year of annual global assessments, with scores representing ocean health for 220 coastal nations and territories using the best available data each year.


~~The Ocean Health Index (OHI) is a scientific framework to quantify ocean-derived
100 benefits to humans to help inform sustainable ocean management24. We lead the
101 assessment of 220 coastal nations and territories annually,24,25 distilling large
102 amounts of complex data into OHI scores that describe global ocean health (see also
103 http://ohi-science.org). The OHI framework can be used in different geographies to
104 inform policy decisions, particularly when repeated through time26. We have used
105 open data science tools to build an OHI "Toolbox" that provides structure, data,
106 code, and instruction to enable our repeated global assessments and the 15+
107 ongoing assessments led by independent groups26. It is not possible to conduct
108 repeated OHI assessments efficiently without using open data science tools for data
109 preparation and collaboration. We know this because we encountered extreme
110 difficulty in reproducing our work without these tools due to our focus on the
111 reproducibility of our scientific methods but not our data science methods.
