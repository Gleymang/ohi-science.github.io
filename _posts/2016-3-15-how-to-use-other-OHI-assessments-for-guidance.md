As the Ocean Health Index is an open-science tool used by inspired scientists and researchers all over the world, we can all benefit from the collective wisdom of an amazing OHI+ community. [**ohi-science.org**](http://ohi-science.org/) aims to facilitate sharing between OHI+ experiences. Here are a few tips on how to learn from and connect with other OHI+ groups: 

- [Projects](http://ohi-science.org/projects/) page, where you could view all the OHI and OHI+ assessments. Click the map to select a country of interest, and then you can explore their data repository, WebApp, documentation, publications, or websites, which are available depending on where they are in the project. The repositories will be especially helpful for technical experts to share code. 

- [Goals](http://ohi-science.org/goals/) page, where you would find a method comparison table for each goal that summarized all the completed studies, including their goal model approach, reference point, and other considerations. 

- [Forum](http://ohi-science.org/forum/), where OHI+ practitioners connect and communicate directly. You can ask and answer conceptual and technical questions emerging from an OHI+ project.
