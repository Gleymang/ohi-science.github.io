Open data science is the combination of open science, data science, and team science. We promote and practice this with the Ocean Health Index by using software tools that make our work transparent, reproducible, and shared publicly online. These concepts are being discussed more and more in the news and in the academic literature. There are so many great articles on these topics that we have started this list, along with a quote from the article to give a sense of its content. 

\*\*We are trying to make this list more comprehensive; please help! You can suggest additions on twitter at [`@OHIScience`](https://twitter.com/ohiscience), or through a pull request on [`GitHub`](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-science.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2017-03-29-Articles-About-Open-Data-Science.md). We will be organizing the list as it grows. Thanks for your help!

    - *"Over the past four years, we have studied more than a dozen scientific consortia involved in data sharing, and we've mapped the landscape of these and another such initiatives. When they work well, consortia act as catalysts, to accomplish what members cannot do alone. But scientists are seldom taught effective strategies to design and manage such coalitions. Here we distil the lessons from our fieldwork into five ways to foster open science."*

    - *"When I asked a handful of post-doc biologists eating brunch in Boston last week how many were teaching themselves to code, every hand went up. They all realized that their curriculum was missing a core element, and they’ve set about rectifying the omission—on their own."*

The journal *Nature* even has a [Toolbox series](http://www.nature.com/news/toolbox) where they discuss software tools and approaches.
