The Ocean Health Index practices and promotes open science, data science, and team science in marine science and policy. We do this by using software tools that make our work transparent, reproducible, and shared publicly online. 

These concepts are getting more visibility in the news, blogs, and also in the academic literature. We have started this list of references on these topics. It is definitely not comprehensive, and suggestions welcome through the [forum](http://ohi-science.org/forum/)

    - *"Over the past four years, we have studied more than a dozen scientific consortia involved in data sharing, and we've mapped the landscape of these and another such initiatives. When they work well, consortia act as catalysts, to accomplish what members cannot do alone. But scientists are seldom taught effective strategies to design and manage such coalitions. Here we distil the lessons from our fieldwork into five ways to foster open science."*
