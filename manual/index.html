class="section level1"> <h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1> <blockquote> <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>This guide provides an overview of conducting an OHI+ assessment. An assessment involves incorporating information from your study area into goal models to calculate Ocean Health Index (OHI) scores using the OHI Toolbox software and WebApp. This process is explained in this guide.</p> </blockquote> <!---## Where you are in the process  > At this stage, you should have **Learned** and **Planned** for your assessment, and are now ready to **Conduct** it.  **Here you will learn how to conduct an independent Ocean Health Index+ (OHI+) assessment.** The OHI+ process consists of four phases. In the first phase, you **learned** about the OHI to understand the philosophy behind the goals and the motivation for conducting a study. In the second phase, you actively **planned** to conduct your OHI+ assessment. Now you will actively **conduct** the assessment by engaging with the work of finding the data, preparing the goal models, and taking the necessary steps to learn how to use the **OHI Toolbox** and related software to produce the final results. This is where the science of data discovery and goal model development comes in. In the final phase, you will **communicate** the findings and results of your assessment with others.  - **Phase 1:** **Learn** about the OHI - **Phase 2:** **Plan** an OHI+ assessment - **Phase 3:** **Conduct** the OHI+ assessment - **Phase 4:** **Communicate** and inform---> <p><strong>The OHI framework</strong> allows you to synthesize the information and priorities relevant to your local context and produce comparable scores. Because the methods of the framework are repeatable, transparent, quantitative, and goal-driven, the process of a carrying out an OHI+ assessment is as valuable as the final results.</p> <p>The first completed assessment for a study area is valuable because it establishes a baseline and highlights the state of information quality and availability in an area. Any subsequent assessments carried out through time are also valuable because they can be used to track and monitor changes in ocean health. Your assessment will require careful thought and consideration along the way, and we encourage documentation and scripting to be done within the OHI Toolbox to facilitate collaboration and transparency, as well as the reproducibility for future assessments.</p> <p>Each OHI+ assessment should have a clear purpose. One of the typical reasons for conducting an independent assessment is to inform policy and management decisions. Assessments can be more relevant to management when they are conducted at the spatial scales at which policy decisions are made, such as states, provinces, or counties. The <strong>regions</strong> and the overall <strong>study area</strong> are definitions that will be used throughout the assessment. The study area is the entire spatial boundary of your assessment, while the regions are the smaller subdivisions within the study area. In the OHI framework, goal scores are calculated for regions separately and then combined to produce an overall OHI score for each study area. The number of regions varies with each assessment’s study area; completed assessments have had between one and 221 regions.</p> <!---add calculation fig---> <blockquote> <p>The process of conducting an OHI+ assessment is as valuable as the final results. Documenting decisions made, as well as the challenges and successes encountered along the way, can lead to better understanding of the system, help inform management decisions, and guide future assessments to track changes through time.</p> </blockquote> <div id="what-to-expect-when-conducting-an-assessment" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> What to expect when conducting an assessment</h2> <blockquote> <p>It is important to include information that best represents your study area, and to make science-driven decisions and clearly document what was done and why. Your team should as creative and insightful as you can be while working within the bounds of informational and technical limitations.</p> </blockquote> <p>There are <strong>key processes and considerations</strong> that will be a part of every assessment. Every assessment should build from the lessons learned of previously completed assessments and identify what local characteristics need to be included in a study. This is done partly by comparing the local situation to situations in previous assessments; it is also done by comparing the default information provided in the WebApp to what is known about local realities. After you have outlined and identified local characteristics and priorities, you should prepare to use the Toolbox software and fit the data you have found to be formatted correctly for that software. Finally, once working with the information within the Toolbox, your team will udpate and improve the methods of the assessment before being able to calculate the final results. You will also visualize the outputs in the WebApp’s maps and flower plots that can be shared with other partners and collaborators. Above all, you should be prepared to <strong>know that this process takes time and is iterative, meaning that you often return to previous steps</strong>.</p> <p>How long does an assessment take? Past assessments have taken between two and three years, with the time varying depending the size and composition of the team, the challenges encountered in discovering and gathering information, and how many models are redeveloped. The amount of data processing and goal model development needed before you will be able to use the Toolbox also affects the amount of time it takes to conduct the assessment. The skill sets of the team members and the amount of technical resources available are also hugely important factors. You should think about which team members are needed at what stage of the process, including an R programmer and a spatial analyst. It will take time for the technical team to become familiar with the OHI Toolbox and GitHub.</p> </div> <div id="overview-of-best-practices-for-ohi-assessments" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Overview of best practices for OHI assessments</h2> <p>Conducting an assessment requires both an understanding of how past assessments have been completed and the innovation to capture important characteristics of your study area using the information available. You can start by understanding the structure of completed assessments at global and smaller scales and the models that were created. Understanding the approaches in different contexts will help you think about what should be done similarly and differently in your local context.</p> <p>Navigating through the WebApp can help frame your thinking and introduce you to the structure of inputs that will be required for the OHI Toolbox software.</p> <div id="understand-completed-ohi-assessments" class="section level3"> <h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Understand completed OHI assessments</h3> <p>It is important to <strong>understand methods used in completed OHI assessments</strong> so that you can identify if previous approaches are appropriate for your assessment or whether you need to redevelop the methods for your study area. In many cases, studying completed OHI assessments will inform your approaches for discovering data and developing goal models later on in the process.</p> <p>The OHI framework was developed through collaboration and iteration. Your assessment can leverage the collective knowledge and insight used in the methods of the global assessment by Halpern <em>et al</em>. in <em>Nature</em> (2012) as well as the subsequent assessments conducted annually (in 2013, 2014, and ongoing). Each annual global assessment has improved upon some of the goal models based on better data availability or a better understanding of the systems involved. Several smaller-scale assessments have been completed that are highly informative as well, and particularly for regional scale assessments. The following studies have been published with supplemental online materials, and are available at <a href="http://ohi-science.org" class="uri">http://ohi-science.org</a>:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Global</strong></li> <li>Halpern et al.

This means understanding the rationale behind the components of the OHI framework and identifying what must be added or removed or redefined to ensure that it best represents the local context. Are all goals relevant to your study area? What should be added, removed, or redefined? In this process it is important to identify not only characteristics that could be included in goal models, but also the important stressors (pressures) and resilience elements within the study area. What are the key issues that should be included for your assessment to be credible, useful, and meaningful? How do people typically relate to the ocean in your area in terms of social and cultural patterns? These are the kinds of questions you should consider prior to assembling the available information.</p> <p>The OHI framework should guide your assessment, but you should not be constrained by it. If a goal is not relevant, it should be removed. If there are elements important to your study area that are not present within the existing framework, how could they be included? Having a clear picture of how the framework should be restructured and what the assessment should include is very important before moving on to assemble information, because otherwise the assessment could be biased by what information is available instead of what is important to include. When specific information is not available there are ways to capture them with indirect measures, called proxies, which will be discussed in the <strong>Assemble Input Information</strong> section.</p> </div> <div id="strategically-define-spatial-boundaries-at-the-finest-possible-scale" class="section level3"> <h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> Strategically define spatial boundaries at the finest possible scale</h3> <p>Identifying the spatial boundaries of the regions within the assessment area is extremely important because OHI scores are calculated for each unique region. Spatial boundaries should be defined with geographic information system (GIS) mapping software at the smallest scale possible, ideally within one management jurisdiction. This is optimal because it is often at these scales where management and policy decisions are made, cultural priorities and management targets are identified, and information is collected in standardized and therefore comparable ways.</p> </div> <div id="assemble-input-information" class="section level3"> <h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.4</span> Assemble input information</h3> <p>There are many decisions to be made when searching for and gathering data, and searches should extend beyond any one expertise, discipline, source, or data-type. This is because your data will come from disparate sources, and you will have to engage experts to help identifying good proxies and indicators, deciding reference points, and developing goal models. OHI+ assessments should incorporate higher-resolution information where possible for goal status models and pressures and resilience measures. The process of discovering and gathering so many different kinds of data and indicators is an important step that you will return to as you continue to conduct the assessment. This is where having a collaborative team that can work across disciplines will be key.</p> </div> <div id="maintain-core-values-and-characteristics-within-the-assessment-framework-regardless-of-limited-information-quality" class="section level3"> <h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.5</span> Maintain core values and characteristics within the assessment framework regardless of limited information quality</h3> <p>The models you develop and reference points you set must reflect the philosophy of the OHI framework while accommodating the attributes and shortcomings of the data. While goal status models developed in completed assessments offer good examples of approaches in different contexts, they should be considered as guides and should not limit exploration into new model development. It will likely be an iterative process to incorporate the best available information into a model that captures the philosophy of the goals. It will also require creative thinking and problem-solving abilities among your team, and documenting the decisions you make is important for transparency, communication and repeatability.</p> </div> <div id="carefully-document-and-share-all-decisions-in-writing-and-computational-code" class="section level3"> <h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.6</span> Carefully document and share all decisions in writing and computational code</h3> <p>It is important to plan for future assessments, as repeated assessments enable you to compare and track how scores have changed over time, with the aim of ultimately informing policy to improve ocean health. Repeated assessments will use the same methods and reference points, but incorporating updated data.</p> <p>Detailed information about how the assessment is conducted will enhance its credibility and reproducibility. Decisions of why information was included and why models were developed in a certain manner are of great importance so that future assessments can incorporate the same logic and understanding of the system — or make improvements. Further, the type of workflow developed and software used to organize and process information will greatly affect the efficiency, transparency, and reproducibility of subsequent assessments. Providing public access to all such information, as well as input data and computational code is becoming the standard for scientific inquiry, so every effort should be made to achieve those aims.</p> </div> </div> <div id="the-toolbox-software-and-webapp" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> The Toolbox software and WebApp</h2> <p>The <strong>OHI Toolbox</strong> is the main software used for organizing and processing information, documenting decisions made, calculating scores, and visualizing results. It was created to facilitate score calculations as well as the organization of information and transparency of the approach. The Toolbox is built with open-source software, meaning that it is freely available for you to use and can be modified to meet your needs. You will access the software from online and will use several free software tools to conduct your assessment in a collaborative, transparent, and reproducible manner.</p> <p>The Toolbox software should be used when your team has gathered the information necessary for the goal models you have developed. The steps of carefully preparing and gathering data layers, indicators, and developing goal models can be done independently of the actual software use; however, if done within the Toolbox structure these steps will be traceable and collaborative. But of course the assessment can be done without all members of your team becoming familiar with the technical aspects of the Toolbox.</p> <p>Accompanying the OHI Toolbox is the <strong>OHI+ WebApp</strong>, which is a visualization tool that displays input information and calculated scores in several ways, including interactive maps and flower plots. Most coastal countries have a WebApp that was created to facilitate planning and communication during assessments. The WebApp visually presents inputs, goal models and calculated scores for each defined region through interactive maps, histograms, and tables. All inputs presented in a country’s WebApps were extracted for each country from global assessments, and scores were calculated using goal models from global assessments.</p> <p>The WebApp is a widely useful communication tool. Not all team collaborators may be involved with the technical aspects of the Toolbox, but the WebApp enables everyone to explore inputs and calculated scores.</p> </div> <div id="outcomes-of-conducting-an-assessment" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Outcomes of conducting an assessment</h2> <p><strong>The process of conducting an OHI assessment can be as valuable as the final results.</strong> This is because while conducting an OHI assessment you will bring together meaningful ocean health information from many disciplines. In doing so, you will have a census of existing information and will also identify knowledge and data gaps. Further, conducting an OHI+ assessment can engage many different groups, including research institutions, government agencies, policy groups, non-governmental organizations, and both the civil and private sectors.</p> <p>Your completed assessment will produce OHI scores for each goal for every region in your study area, and scores within the assessment can be compared with each other. These scores will not be quantitatively comparable to those of other OHI assessments because they differ in the underlying inputs, goal models, and reference points. The only <em>quantitative</em> comparisons can be made within an assessment’s study area, whether between regions or through time. However, <em>qualitative</em> comparisons between different OHI assessments can be made because the scores are an indication of how far a region is to achieving its own targets. For instance, if two study areas have scores of seventy and sixty-five, it should be interpreted that the first study area is closer to its management targets than the second is, but since these management targets are different (in addition to the underlying data and models), they cannot be quantitatively compared.</p> </div> </div> <div id="overview-of-the-ohi-webapp" class="section level1"> <h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Overview of the OHI WebApp</h1> <blockquote> <p><strong>Section Summary:</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Your team should be familiar with the structure of the WebApp since it demonstrates how information is organized and displayed. As you update inputs with local information, you can view these updates with the WebApp.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>OHI+ WebApps</strong> are websites created to facilitate independent assessments. The WebApp is a good starting point when conducting an assessment because you can easily navigate how information is organized and displayed. The WebApp is also meant to be used to visualize and communicate results.</p> <p>The WebApp displays input information (data and indicators) as well as final OHI scores. When prepared and formatted for the OHI, inputs are called <strong>layers</strong> and are used in all OHI calculations, including goal models, pressures and resilience. By default, the WebApp only displays layers and score information that have been extracted from the latest global assessment and allocated to subcountry regions with the study area. The default display therefore does not provide fine resolution nor does it guarantee accurate data for each study area. You will substitute these layers with higher-quality information at the local scale in your assessment. However, the default layers can be used as inputs into your assessment in cases where no better information exists. <strong>Incorporating the best information possible will generate results that best represent your study area.</strong></p> <p>The WebApp is powered by the <strong>OHI Toolbox</strong>, which organizes all of the layers and calculates Index scores. The Toolbox is where you will actively work to prepare and format layers and develop goal models, which can then be displayed with the WebApp.</p> <p>A default WebApp is available for most coastal nations.

The boundaries for these subcountry regions are usually states, provinces, or districts reported to Global Administrative Areas (GADM: www.gadm.org). These land-based regions are extended offshore to divide the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) into offshore regions of the study area. Offshore regions are important for Index calculations, in part because scores for each region are combined using the offshore area to weight the average of the final Index score.

Each branch is a copy of a repository that is meant to be modified independently of other branches. This is done to ensure that changes made to one branch will not affect the information in another branch. This allows for active collaboration and offers a way to archive different outputs to Index calculations. For example, the <em>published</em> branch shows information that has been vetted for sharing, while the <em>draft</em> branch can be used for experimentation. These branches can be merged together at any time, and that is typically done when important milestones in the assessment process are reached. The <em>subcountry</em> folders displayed also offer another way to compartmentalize outcomes by allowing you to compare different <em>scenarios</em> within the same branch of your repository.</p> <blockquote> <p>The App displays a <em>published</em> branch by default.

It is important because all data, analyses, and results will be at this spatial scale, and boundaries may be used to aggregate or disaggregate information reported at spatial scales different from your regions. Boundary definitions should match the purpose of the assessment and be informed by the scale at which information is available.</p> <p><strong>It is possible to redefine the spatial boundaries for your study area and regions.</strong> The boundaries displayed in your WebApp** are provided by default using subcountry region definitions from Global Administrative Areas (GADM: www.gadm.org).</p> <blockquote> <p>Note that the OHI does not take a stance on disputed territories.

You will need someone with GIS skills to create a <strong>shapefile</strong> that will be used by the Toolbox to display your information. The shapefile will also be used to extract information for each of your defined regions when data are reported in raster format for a different area. For more information see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system" class="uri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile" class="uri">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile</a>.</p> <p>Regions must be unique (non-overlapping), and boundaries must be drawn offshore, extending to the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) edge in most cases. Offshore boundaries should be made with spatial methods in order to extend boundaries from those designated on land. One possible method is to create boundaries with Thiessen Polygons, and we provide a Python script that can be used, but it requires ArcGIS. The Python script and further details can be found at <a href="http://ohi-science.org/pages/create_regions.html" class="uri">http://ohi-science.org/pages/create_regions.html</a>.

Buffers are not necessary for display in the WebApp but they will be important for later layer preparation. For example, the global assessment used coastal population information, and raster data were available for entire countries. This meant that ‘coastal’ had to be defined: for global assessments it was defined as 25 miles from the coast. To extract just the coastal population from the population raster file, we created a 25 mile inland buffer for each reporting region. But to extract mangrove data for each region from raster files, global assessments used 1km inland and 1km offshore as the buffer.</p> <p>At this point, you may not know which buffers you will need, as they depend on the data available, your goal models and definitions. Some buffers used in the global assessments were 1km inland, 25miles inland, 1km offshore, 3nm offshore.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div id="discovering-and-gathering-input-information" class="section level1"> <h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Discovering and gathering input information</h1> <p>A hallmark of the OHI is that it uses freely-available existing information (data and indicators) to create the models that capture the philosophies of individual goals. The quality of the inputs are important because calculated Index scores area only as good ad the inputs on which they are based. Assembling the appropriate input information, which means both discovering and gathering data and indicators, is an important part of any OHI assessment.</p> <p>Once your team has tailored the OHI framework appropriately for your study area and identified the information that ideally would be included, the data discovery and gathering process can begin. There are many decisions to make when deciding which data are available and appropriate to include in your assessment. Finding appropriate data requires problem-solving abilities and creativity, particularly when ideal data are unavailable. You will need input information to calculate status models as well as pressures and resilience.</p> <div id="thinking-creatively" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Thinking creatively</h2> <blockquote> <p>Remember that you are trying to capture information that is meaningful for ocean health.</p> </blockquote> <p>Humans interact with and depend upon the oceans in complex ways, some of which are easy to measure and others of which are harder to define. More familiar measurements include providing seafood, or disposing of waste. A less familiar measurement is how marine-related jobs affect coastal communities, or how different people receive or perceive benefits simply from living near the ocean. Thinking creatively and exploring the information available can make your assessment more representative of reality.</p> <p>Data used in OHI assessments spans a wide array of disciplines beyond oceanography and marine ecology. It is important to think creatively and beyond the interests of a specific institution or one particular field of study. Therefore, it is necessary to look beyond the most known or obvious data sources to find data relevant for the goals in the study area. Discussions with colleagues, literature searches, emails to experts, and search engines are good ways to understand what kinds of data are collected and to hunt for appropriate data. Investigate what kinds of information are available from government and public records, scientific literature, academic studies, surveys and reports etc.</p> </div> <div id="data-sources" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Data sources</h2> <p>Existing data and indicators can be gathered from many sources across environmental, social, and economic disciplines. This includes government reports and project websites, peer-reviewed literature, masters and PhD theses, university websites, and information from non-profit organizations, among others.</p> <p>All data must be rescaled to specific reference points (targets) before being combined with the Toolbox; therefore setting these reference points at the appropriate scale is a fundamental component of any OHI assessment. This requires your assessment team to capture the philosophy of each Index goal and sub-goal using the best available data and indicators. Indicators that are already scaled (e.g., from 0-1 or 0-10) can easily be incorporated into your assessment; they have already been scaled to some kind of identified target or reference point. Data that have not been scaled in most cases will need to be, whether this is by scaling to the maximum value in the range or to some other understood value. You should think about how you would rescale data during your search.</p> <p>Because data and indicators will come from different sources, they will also have different formatting. To include these data and indicators in your assessment, you will need to process these files into the format required by the Toolbox, which is explained in the section <strong>Formatting Data for the Toolbox</strong>. When data have been prepared and formatted for the Toolbox, they are called <strong>layers.</strong> Because creating layers can be quite time-intensive, data should only be prepared for the Toolbox after final decisions have been made to include the data or indicator in your assessment, and after the appropriate goal model and reference points have been finalized.</p> </div> <div id="gathering-responsibilities" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Gathering responsibilities</h2> <p>Gathering appropriate data requires identifying and accessing existing data. It is important that team members responsible for data discovery make thoughtful decisions about whether data are appropriate for the assessment. Data discovery and acquisition are typically an iterative process, as there are both practical and philosophical reasons for including or excluding data.</p> </div> <div id="requirements-for-data-and-indicators" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Requirements for data and indicators</h2> <p>There are six requirements to remember when investigating (or ‘scoping’) potential data and indicators that are presented in this section. It is important that data satisfy as many of these requirements as possible. To meet these requirements, you may have use appropriate methods to fill gaps in the data set. Data sources may need to be excluded from the analyses if requirements are not met and gap-filling solutions are not possible. If data cannot be included, you may elect to use layers from the global assessment or identify other data or modeling approaches.</p> <div id="relevance-to-ocean-health" class="section level3"> <h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.1</span> Relevance to ocean health</h3> <p>There must be a clear connection between the data and ocean health, and determining this will be closely linked to each goal model.</p> </div> <div id="accessibility" class="section level3"> <h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.2</span> Accessibility</h3> <p>The two main points regarding accessibility are whether the source is open access and whether the data or indicators will be updated regularly.</p> <p>The Index was created in the spirit of transparency and open-access, using open-source software and online platforms such as GitHub, is to ensure as much accessibility and open collaboration as possible. Data and indicators included should also follow these guidelines, so that anyone wishing to understand more about the Index may be able to see what data were used and how. For this reason we emphasize the importance of using data that may be made freely downloadable, as well as the importance of clearly documenting all decisions and reasons for the choices made in selecting data, indicators, and models.</p> <p>Index scores can be recalculated annually as new data become available. This can establish a baseline of ocean health and serve as a monitoring mechanism to evaluate the effectiveness of actions and policies in improving the status of overall ocean health. This is good to keep in mind while looking for data: will it be available again in the future? It is also important to document the sources of all data so that it is both transparent where it came from and you will be able to find it in the future.</p> </div> <div id="quality" class="section level3"> <h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.3</span> Quality</h3> <p>Understanding how the data or indicators were collected or created is important. Are they collected by a respected organization with quality control? Are there any protocol changes to be aware of? For instance, were there changes in the collection protocol to be aware of when interpreting temporal trends?</p> </div> <div id="reference-point" class="section level3"> <h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.4</span> Reference point</h3> <p>Most data will need to be scaled to a reference point. As you consider different data sources it is important to think about or identify what a reasonable reference point may be. Ask the following types of questions as you explore data possibilities:</p> <ul> <li>Has past research identified potential targets for these data?</li> <li>For example, fisheries goal require a Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY).</li> <li>Have policy targets been set regarding these data?</li> <li>For example, maximum levels of pollutants allowed in beaches.</li> <li>Would a historic reference point be an appropriate target?</li> <li>For example, the percent of habitat coverage before coastal development took place.</li> <li>Could a region within the study area be set as a spatial reference point?</li> <li>For example, a certain region is regarded as the leader in creating protected areas.</li> </ul> </div> <div id="appropriate-spatial-scale" class="section level3"> <h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.5</span> Appropriate spatial scale</h3> <p>Data must be available for every region within the study area. It is not always possible to fully meet the spatial and temporal requirements with each source. In these cases, provided that the gaps are not extensive, it can still be possible to use these data if appropriate gap-filling techniques are used (See: <strong>Formatting Data for Toolbox</strong> section).</p> </div> <div id="appropriate-temporal-scale" class="section level3"> <h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.6</span> Appropriate temporal scale</h3> <p>Data must be available for ideally the five most-recent years to calculate the recent trend. For some goals, where temporal reference points are desirable, longer time series are preferable.</p> </div> <div id="the-process-of-information-discovery" class="section level3"> <h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.7</span> The process of information discovery</h3> <p>The most important thing to remember when gathering data and indicators is that they must contribute to measuring ocean health. Not all information that enhances our knowledge of marine processes directly convey information about ocean health and may not be appropriate within the OHI framework. Because of this, compiled indicators can sometimes be more suitable than raw data measuring single marine attributes.</p> <p>Whether you are working goal-by-goal, or layer by layer, it is important to consider where you can find synergies in data discovery. For example, while you are looking for information for the fisheries goal, you may also find data layers for fishing pressures, such as metrics on bycatch or trawling intensity. This will save you time and allow you to start thinking about how to rank pressures and resilience weights on your goals as well. Conceptually, it will help your team build a picture of how your goals are interlocking in a way that is reflective of the actual linkages that exist in the connected systems you are studying. Some key examples are listed below, and are further explained in the following sections.</p> <p>You should begin by understanding and comparing the best approaches used in assessments that have been completed, including the global assessments (Halpern <em>et al</em>, 2012; 2013), Brazil (Elfes <em>et al</em>. 2014), Fiji (Selig <em>et al</em>., 2014), and the U.S. West Coast Assessment (Halpern <em>et al</em>., 2014). For OHI+ assessments, if finer-resolution local data were available in the study area, these data were either incorporated into modified goal models that used locally appropriate and informed approaches or into the existing global goal model. When local data were not available, the global-scale data and global goal models were used, which is least desirable because it does not provide more information than the global study.</p> <p>When looking for data, the following decision tree may be useful when going goal-by-goal for discovering data and developing models:</p> <div class="figure"> <img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1bJ3lk0stX78YM_VVR8VDAmdVUcMv4riSZk-0L2x8ybw/pub?w=624&amp;h=336" /> </div> </div> <div id="example-u.s.-west-coast-data-discovery" class="section level3"> <h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.8</span> Example: U.S. West Coast data discovery</h3> <p>Below are examples of some decisions made when exploring available data for the U.S. West Coast assessment. Determining whether certain data could be included began with a solid understanding of the layers and models included in the global assessment. Since the U.S. West Coast is a data-rich region, finer-resolution local data could be used in place of many of the global data layers. The U.S. West Coast assessment had five regions: Washington, Oregon, Northern California, Central California, and Southern California.</p> </div> <div id="reasons-data-were-excluded" class="section level3"> <h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.9</span> Reasons data were excluded</h3> <p>There are a lot of existing data that contribute to our scientific understanding of ocean processes and interactions but are not ideal for the OHI. Reasons to exclude data are both due to practical requirements (e.g., spatial or temporal resolution) and philosophical requirements (i.e., they do not help capture the attributes of interest for assessing ocean health). Some common reasons for excluding data are:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>The data do not cover the entire area of the reporting region</strong>. The state of California had excellent, long-term data on public attendance at state parks that would have been quite useful in the calculation of the tourism and recreation goal. However, data were only available for three of the five regions (the three California regions but not Oregon and Washington), so they could not be used.</p></li> <li><p><strong>There is not a clear and scientifically observed relationship between the data and ocean health</strong>. Along the U.S. West Coast, kelp beds are a very important habitat because of their contribution to biodiversity and coastal protection. However, kelp coverage variation is driven primarily by abiotic natural forcing (wave or storm disturbance and temperature) and thus is not a good indicator of kelp forest health, particularly in the case of anthropogenic impacts. For these reasons kelp coverage was not included in the assessment.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The feature being measured may provide benefits to people, but this feature is not derived from marine or coastal ecosystems</strong>. Sea walls and riprap provide coastal protection to many people along the U.S. West Coast. However, these structures are not a benefit that is derived from the marine ecosystems, so only coastal habitats were included in the calculation of this goal. These data can be included as a pressure due to habitat loss. They were not used as a resilience measure because they can often have negative side effects (e.g., by altering sedimentation dynamics), and because they have limited long-term sustainability (i.e., they need maintenance).</p></li> <li><p><strong>Data collection is biased and might misrepresent ocean health</strong>. The U.S. Endangered Species Act identifies a species list focused on species of concern within the US. As such, these data are biased in the context of ocean health since they only assess species whose populations may be in danger. For the calculation of the biodiversity goal, using these data would be inappropriate because this goal represents the status of all species in the region, not just those that are currently of conservation concern. Using these data may have shown the status of biodiversity to be lower than it really is because the selection of species to assess was already biased towards species of concern.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Time series data are not long enough to calculate a trend or a reference point</strong> (when a historical reference point is most appropriate). For the U.S. West Coast, the current extent of seagrass habitats was available, however, these do not exist for previous points in time in most areas, so could not be used to calculate the trend or set a historical reference point. Therefore, we estimated the trend in health of seagrass habitats using as a proxy the trend in the main stressor (i.e., turbidity). In other words, we assumed that the rate of seagrass loss was directly proportional to the rate of increase in turbidity. Similar solutions may be used to estimate trends in your own assessment, if there is scientific support for assuming that the trend of what we want to assess (or the relationship between the current state and the state in the reference year) has a strong relationship with the trend of the proxy data available.</p></li> </ul> <!---Option: JSL develop the discussion of searching not only for strict data within your country to use, but studies that have been done anywhere in the world, demonstrating relationships between different things (eg camaroneras effects on mangrove condition)---> </div> </div> </div> <div id="the-ocean-health-index-toolbox" class="section level1"> <h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> The Ocean Health Index Toolbox</h1> <blockquote> <p><strong>Section Summary:</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>In this section, you will learn the basics of how to use the OHI Toolbox to conduct your assessment.

These files and scripts are stored in two ‘<em>repositories</em>’: folders that are synchronized with collaborators. The first folder is your <strong>assessment repository</strong> that has a three-letter code, such as <em>esp</em> for Spain or <em>ecu</em> for Ecuador. You will edit this repository with your data, goal models, and updated pressures and resilience matrix tables. The second repository is called <strong>ohicore</strong> and it contains core functions for combining your data and goal models to calculate OHI scores.

This means that each assessment repository isolates the information used for each region in the global assessment and stores it in a separate OHI+ assessment repository. Therefore, it can be an easy way to explore the inputs used in the global assessment for one specific place. When conducting an assessment, you will replace and modify as much of this information with local information that better represents your study area, since information reported at a national scale cannot always be attributed to its subcountry regions, as has been done in most cases in each OHI+ assessment repository.

You are able to navigate through these files both at <code>www.github.com/OHI-Science</code> and on your own computer once you have cloned the repository to your computer. GitHub is an online platform used by the OHI that facilitates collaboration and archives past versions of all files with the author identified. It can be accessed remotely by all members of your team and enables team members to synchronize their work together. Because all versions are saved, you can return to previous work and also compare different points in history to track how changes you make affect the output scores.

The global assessment had information for your country at the the spatial scale of the entire country, whereas your assessment has information for each subcountry region within your country.

When this occurred, the layer was given a suffix of <code>_gl2014</code> to indicate that information is equal across all regions in the study area. While these layers may not provide much useful information to your assessment, the proper input structure is provided in these layers. Some layers contain information such as km2 of habitat that could not be equally allocated across all regions since this would provide a sum much greater than reality. In these cases, layers were down-weighted based on the proportion of offshore area or coastal population density. These layers have the suffix <code>_sc2014</code> with an indication of what was used to downweight. While this method removes any error of inflated sums and provides the Toolbox with functioning layers, the allocation of these values may not be sensical to your study (i.e. if corals are only present in some regions of your study area but they are allocated to all).</p> <div class="figure"> <img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1QlpBKXfBZFPROK5Xvexkj6ABwsUMQQT52uhIKdVd7iI/pub?w=576&amp;h=288" alt="Differences in input layers with equal information for each region (suffixed with _gl2014) and weighted information for each region (suffixed with _sc2014)." /><p class="caption">Differences in input layers with equal information for each region (suffixed with <code>_gl2014</code>) and weighted information for each region (suffixed with <code>_sc2014</code>).</p> </div> </div> </div> <div id="layers-empty_swapping-global-mean.csv" class="section level4"> <h4><span class="header-section-number">5.1.3.9</span> <em>layers-empty_swapping-global-mean.csv</em></h4> <p><code>layers-empty_swapping-global-mean.csv</code> contains a list of layers where information for your country was not available for the global assessment.

Each data layer (data input) has its own <em>.csv</em> file, which is combined with others within the Toolbox for the model calculations. These data layers are used for calculating goal scores, meaning that they are inputs for status, trend, pressures, and resilience. The global analysis included over 100 data layer files, and there will probably be as many in your own assessments. This section describes and provides examples of how to format the data layers for the Toolbox.</p> <p>OHI goal scores are calculated at the scale of the reporting unit, which is called a ‘<strong>region</strong>’ and then combined using an area-weighted average to produce the score for the overall area assessed, called a ‘<strong>study area</strong>’. The OHI Toolbox expects each data file to be in a specific format, with data available for every region within the study area, with data layers organized in ‘long’ format (as few columns as possible), and with a unique region identifier (<em>rgn_id</em>) associated with a single <em>score</em> or <em>value</em>. In order to calculate trend, input data must be available as a time series for at least 5 recent years (and the longer the time series the better, as this can be used in setting temporal reference points).</p> <p>The example below shows information for a study area with 4 regions. There are two different (and separate) data layer files: tourism count (<code>tr_total.csv</code>) and natural products harvested, in metric tonnes (<code>np_harvest_tonnes.csv</code>). Each file has data for four regions (1-4) in different years, and the second has an additional ‘categories’ column for the different types of natural products that were harvested. In this example, the two data layers are appropriate for status calculations with the Toolbox because:</p> <ol style="list-style-type: decimal"> <li>At least five years of data are available,</li> <li>There are no data gaps</li> <li>Data are presented in ‘long’ or ‘narrow’ format (not ‘wide’ format – see “<strong>Long Formatting</strong>”&quot; section).</li> </ol> <p><strong>Example of data in the appropriate format:</strong></p> <div class="figure"> <img src="fig/formatting_data_example.png" /> </div> </div> <div id="gapfilling" class="section level3"> <h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.2</span> Gapfilling</h3> <p>It is important that data prepared for the Toolbox have no missing values or ‘gaps’. Data gaps can occur in two main ways: 1) <strong>temporal gaps</strong>: when several years in a time series in a single region have missing data, and 2) <strong>spatial gaps</strong>: when all years for a region have missing data (and therefore the whole region is ‘missing’ for that data layer).</p> <p>How these gaps are filled will depend on the data and regions themselves, and requires thoughtful, logical decisions to most reasonably fill gaps. Each data layer can be gapfilled using different approaches. Some data layers will require both temporal and spatial gapfilling. The examples below highlight some example of temporal and spatial gapfilling.</p> <p>All decisions of gapfilling should be documented to ensure transparency and reproducibility. The examples below are in Excel, but programming these changes in software like R is preferred because it promotes easy transparency and reproducibility.</p> <div id="temporal-gapfilling" class="section level4"> <h4><span class="header-section-number">5.2.2.1</span> Temporal gapfilling</h4> <p>Temporal gaps occur when a region is missing data for some years. The Toolbox requires data for each year for every region. It is important to make an informed decision about how to temporally gapfill data.</p> <div class="figure"> <img src="fig/temporal_gaps.png" /> </div> <p>Often, regression models are the best way to estimate data and fill temporal gaps. Here we give an example that assumes a linear relationship between the year and value variables within a region. If data do not fit a linear framework, other models may be fit to help with gapfilling. Here we give an example assuming linearity.</p> <p>Using a linear model can be done in most programming languages using specific functions, but here we show this step-by-step using functions in Excel for Region 1.</p> <p><strong>Temporal gapfilling example (assumes linearity: able to be represented by a straight line on a graph)):</strong></p> <p>There are four steps to temporally gapfill with a linear model, illustrated in the figures with four columns.</p> <p><strong>1. Calculate the slope for each region</strong></p> <p>The first step is to calculate the slope of the line that is fitted through the available data points. This can be done in Excel using the <strong>SLOPE(known_y’s,known_x’s)</strong> function as highlighted in the figure below. In this case, the x-axis is <em>years</em> (2005, 2006, etc…), the y-axis is <em>count</em>, and the Excel function automatically plots and fits a line through the known values (177.14 in 2005, 212.99 in 2008, and 228.81 in 2009), and subsequently calculates the slope (12.69).</p> <div class="figure"> <img src="fig/filling_temporal_gaps_slope.png" /> </div> <p><strong>2. Calculate the y-intercept for each region</strong></p> <p>The next step is to calculate the intercept of the line that is fitted through the available data points. This can be done in Excel similarly as for the slope calculation, using the the <strong>INTERCEPT(known_y’s,known_x’s)</strong> function that calculates the y-intercept (-25273.89) of the fitted line.</p> <div class="figure"> <img src="fig/filling_temporal_gaps_intercept.png" /> </div> <p><strong>3. Calculate y for all years</strong></p> <p>The slope and y-intercept that were calculated in steps 1 and 2 can then be used along with the year (independent variable) to calculate the unknown ‘y-values’. To do so, simply replace the known three values into the <strong>y = mx + b</strong> equation (m=slope, x=year, b=intercept), to calculate the unknown ‘count’ for a given year (189.39 in 2006, and 202.08 in 2007).</p> <div class="figure"> <img src="fig/filling_temporal_gaps_value.png" /> </div> <p><strong>4. Replace modeled values into original data where gaps had occurred</strong></p> <p>Substitute these modeled values that were previously gaps in the timeseriew. <em>The data layer is now ready for the Toolbox, gapfilled and in the appropriate format.</em></p> </div> <div id="spatial-gapfilling" class="section level4"> <h4><span class="header-section-number">5.2.2.2</span> Spatial gapfilling</h4> <p>Spatial gaps are when no data are available for a particular region. The Toolbox requires data for each region. It is important to make an informed decision about how to spatially gapfilling data.</p> <div class="figure"> <img src="fig/gapfilling_spatial.png" /> </div> <p>To fill gaps spatially, you must assume that one region is like another, and data from another region is adequate to be substituted in place of the missing data. This will depend on the type of data and the properties of the regions requiring gapfilling. For example, if a region is missing data but has similar properties to a different region that does have data, the missing data could be ‘borrowed’ from the region with information. Each data layer can be gapfilled using a different approach when necessary.</p> <p><strong>Characteristics of regions requiring gapfilling that can help determine which type of spatial gapfilling to use:</strong></p> <ol style="list-style-type: decimal"> <li><p>proximity: can it be assumed that nearby regions have similar properties?</p></li> <li><p>study area: are data reported for the study area, and can those data be used for subcountry regions?</p></li> <li><p>demographic information: can it be assumed a region with a similar population size has similar data?</p></li> </ol> <p><strong>Spatial gapfilling example:</strong></p> <p>For a certain data layer, suppose the second region (<em>rgn_id 2</em>) has no data reported, as illustrated in the figure above. How to spatially gapfill <em>rgn_id 2</em> requires thinking about the properties and characteristics of the region and the data, in this case, tourist count.</p> <p>Here are properties that can be important for decision making:</p> <p><em>rgn_id 2</em>:</p> <ul> <li>is located between <em>rgn_id 1</em> and 3</li> <li>is larger than <em>rgn_id 1</em></li> <li>has similar population size/demographics to <em>rgn_id 3</em></li> <li>has not been growing as quickly as <em>rgn_id 4</em></li> </ul> <p>There is no absolute answer of how to best gapfill <em>rgn_id 2</em>. Here are a few reasonable possibilities:</p> <p>Assign <em>rgn_id 2</em> values from:</p> <ul> <li><em>rgn_id 1</em> because it is in close proximity to <em>rgn_id 2</em></li> <li><em>rgn_id 3</em> because it is in close proximity to <em>rgn_id 2</em> and has similar population size/demographics</li> <li><em>rgn_id 1</em> and 3 averaged since they are in close proximity to <em>rgn_id 2</em></li> </ul> <p>Suppose the decision was made to gapfill <em>rgn_id 2</em> using the mean of <em>rgn_id 1</em> and <em>3</em> since this would use a combination of both of those regions. Again, other possibilities could be equally correct. But some form of spatial gapfilling is required so a decision must be made. The image below illustrates this in Excel.</p> <div class="figure"> <img src="fig/gapfilling_spatial_example.png" /> </div> <p>The data layer is now ready for the Toolbox, gapfilled and in the appropriate format.</p> </div> </div> <div id="long-formatting" class="section level3"> <h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.3</span> Long formatting</h3> <p>The Toolbox expects data to be in ‘long’ or ‘narrow’ format. Below are examples of correct and incorrect formatting, and tips on how to transform data into the appropriate format.</p> <p><strong>Example of data in an incorrect format:</strong></p> <div class="figure"> <img src="fig/formatting_long_example.png" /> </div> <p>With ‘wide’ format, data layers are more difficult to combine with others and more difficult to read and to analyze.</p> <p><strong>Transforming data into ‘narrow’ format:</strong></p> <p>Data are easily transformed in a programming language such as R.</p> <p>In R, the <code>reshape</code> package has the <code>melt</code> command, which will melt the data from a wide format into a narrow format. It also can <code>cast</code> the data back into a wide format if desired.

Data values will then be found in a new column called <em>value</em>.</p> <p>The final step is optional: ordering the data will make it easier for humans to read (R and the Toolbox can read these data without this final step):</p> <p><strong>Example of data in the appropriate (long) format:</strong></p> <div class="figure"> <img src="fig/formatting_long_example_2.png" /> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div id="installing-the-toolbox" class="section level1"> <h1><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Installing the Toolbox</h1> <blockquote> <p><strong>Section Summary:</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>In this section, you will learn how to successfully download, install, and use the software required to conduct an assessment.

We recommend doing as much data manipulation as possible in a programming language like R, to maximize transparency and reproducibility. When modifying R scripts such as <code>functions.R</code>, you will need to work in R.</p> <p>We recommend syncing with either the GitHub App or with RStudio. Both methods require you to commit your changes, before pulling any updates and pushing your modifications. The GitHub App combines the pulling and pushing into one step, called syncing.

The rankings ensure that within a particular goal (e.g. within a row of the pressures matrix), the stressors that more strongly influence the goal’s delivery have a larger contribution to that goal’s overall pressure score. Therefore, the rankings are assigned independently of the actual pressure scores, and only determine their importance within the calculations.</p> <div class="figure"> <img src="fig/register_new_pressures.png" /> </div> </div> </div> <div id="modify-the-resilience-matrix-if-necessary" class="section level3"> <h3><span class="header-section-number">7.3.4</span> Modify the resilience matrix (if necessary)</h3> <p>Resilience is included in OHI as the sum of the ecological factors and social initiatives (policies, laws, etc.) that can positively affect goal scores by reducing or eliminating pressures.

For example, fisheries regulations do not affect the conservation of sand dunes, so this habitat should not use any of the fisheries combos. If the general resilience categories are relevant to the habitat, the next step is to select one resilience layer within the <code>fishing_v…</code> and <code>habitat...</code> categories that most adequately captures the suite of combined resilience variables that affect the habitat. For example, the sand dune habitat is a strictly coastal habitat, so the most appropriate resilience layer would be the one that uses the MPA_coast (i.e., <code>habitat_combo</code>). The rocky reef and soft bottom, on the other hand, should definitely include fisheries and habitat regulations. So, you’ll need to choose a fisheries and a habitat combo for these two habitats. To do so, consider:</p> <ol style="list-style-type: decimal"> <li>For which habitats should you use both a fishery and a habitat combo, or just use a habitat combo?</li> </ol> <ul> <li>fisheries regulations do not affect the conservation of sand-dunes, so this habitat should not use any of the fisheries combos. Also, this is a strictly coastal habitat, so choose the habitat layer that uses the <code>MPA_coast</code> instead of the <code>MPA_eez</code>, i.e. <code>habitat_combo</code> (and, as mentioned above, choose the coastal version of biodiversity, i.e. <code>species_diversity_3nm</code>).</li> <li>The rocky reef and soft bottom, on the other hand, should definitely include fisheries regulations. So you’ll need to choose a fisheries and a habitat combo for these two habitats.</li> </ul> <ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal"> <li>Which fisheries and habitat combos for <code>rocky_reef</code> and <code>soft_bottom</code>? The choice depends on two things:</li> </ol> <ul> <li>whether they are coastal habitats (within 3nm of the coast) or EEZ-wide habitats <ul> <li>if coastal, use the fisheries and habitat combos with <code>MPA_coast</code> (<code>fishing_v1</code>, <code>fishing_v3</code>, <code>habitat_combo</code>), and the <code>species_diversity_3nm</code> layer</li> <li>if EEZ-wide, use the fisheries and habitat combos with <code>MPA_eez</code> (<code>fishing_v1_eez</code>, <code>fishing_v2_eez</code>, <code>fishing_v3_eez</code>, <code>habitat_combo_eez</code>), and the <code>species_diversity</code> layer</li> </ul></li> <li>whether the fisheries occurring on that habitat are mainly artisanal, mainly commercial, or both <ul> <li>if only commercial fisheries, use a layer that only uses the <code>Mora</code> data <code>fishing_v1..</code>)</li> <li>if only artisanal/small-scale fisheries, use a layer that only uses the <code>Mora_s4</code> data (<code>fishing_v3..</code>)</li> <li>if both, use a layer that uses both <code>Mora</code> and <code>Mora_s4</code> data (<code>fishing_v2..</code>)</li> </ul></li> </ul> <ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal"> <li>It may also be that the existing global combo layers are not appropriate for your habitats. For example, if rocky reef is mainly coastal, and it is fished by both commercial and artisanal methods, then we need a new combo that uses <code>Mora</code>, <code>Mora_s4</code>, <code>CBD_hab</code>, and <code>MPA_coast</code> (this is the same as <code>fishing_v2_eez</code>, but we use the <code>MPA_coast</code> layer instead of the <code>MPA_eez</code>). All other combinations are already present.</li> <li><p>Another issue to consider is whether local data are available to improve the pressure layers (that are based on global data). For example, if there are local data on Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and any areas with special regulations, this should be used to generate the <code>MPA_coast</code> and <code>MPA_eez</code> layers.You may know that only certain types of protected areas are closed to fisheries, and may want to only include those. Also, local datasets may be more accurate and regularly updated. **NOTE: in the global study, these are the same datasets used to calculate the status of Lasting Special Places (LSP).</p></li> <li>How to update <code>resilience_matrix.csv</code>?</li> </ol> <ul> <li>write the complete list of layers you want to use for each habitat. Based on the above, for example, <code>soft bottom</code> in Israel matches the combination of layers called <em>soft bottom, with corals</em> in the default <code>resilience_matrix.csv</code>. But the <code>rocky_reef</code> and <code>sand_dunes</code> don’t seem to match any existing combination, so you’ll probably need to delete some of the rows, e.g. the <em>coral only</em>, and replace with new ad-hoc rows.</li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> <div id="modifying-goal-models" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">7.5</span> Modifying goal models</h2> <!---OM: this is an optional new figure; drafts are commented like so in these Tbx sections.

Make assumptions about fisheries regulations:</strong></p> <p>If you assume that fisheries are depleted and there isn’t very much fisheries regulation, and you are using the CMSY method to assess B/Bmsy, the original model may work well. If, however, the catch of a species declined because fisheries regulations have closed or limited the fishery, or if a fishery was abandoned for economic reasons (e.g., change in consumer prefereces, market price dynamics, etc.), the model may be too pessimistic and understimate B/Bmsy. In that case it may be best to use a version with a uniform prior on final biomass, instead of the constrained prior.<br />The original constrained prior on final biomass is set by this line within the code:</p> <pre><code>finalbio    &lt;- if(ct[nyr]/max(ct) &gt; 0.5) {c(0.3,0.7)} else {c(0.01,0.4)}</code></pre> <p>The model uses a uniform prior if that line is replaced with:</p> <pre><code>finalbio    &lt;- c(0.01,0.7)</code></pre> <p><strong>3. Use data at a different spatial resolution than the final assessment:</strong></p> <p>See notes above for <code>fis_proparea_saup2rgn</code></p> <p><strong>4. Calculate B, or Bmsy:</strong></p> <p>The CMSY model calculates B/Bmsy as a ratio, it does not estimate the two variables separately.</p> <p><strong>5. Use catch per unit of effort (CPUE):</strong></p> <p>The CMSY model requires total biomass removed by fisheries, and uses catch as a proxy for that. It cannot use CPUE. Other more sophisticated stock assessment models use CPUE and may be employed. We do not provide documentation for the use of these other models.</p> <p><strong>6. Use other life-history characteristics, in addition to resilience:</strong></p> <p>The CMSY model does not use more detailed information. Other more sophisticated stock assessment models use other life-history traits such as fecundity, larval dispersal, r, K, Lmax, etc., and may be employed. We do not provide documentation for the use of these other models.</p> <p><strong>7. Create a ‘taxonkey’ to assign to each species:</strong></p> <p>When replacing the SAUP_FAO data with your own data, assign a key of 600000 to all species. For all catch that is reported at genus or coarser taxonomic level, you will have to choose an appropriate taxonkey. You can create your own key, from 100000 to 500000, based on your own judgment of how many species may be reported under that same denomination, and how different they may be (all that matters for the toolbox code is whether the number starts with a 1,2,3,4,5 or 6 with 1 being the coarsest, such as ‘miscellaneous marine animals’, or ‘crustaceans nei’).</p> </div> <div id="resources" class="section level4"> <h4><span class="header-section-number">7.8.1.3</span> Resources</h4> <p>Martell, S &amp; Froese, R (2013) “A simple method for estimating MSY from catch and resilience”. <em>Fish and Fisheries</em>, DOI: 10.1111/j.1467-2979.2012.00485.x. <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CCkQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.iotc.org%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fdocuments%2F2013%2F06%2FIOTC-2013-WPNT03-INF01%2520-%2520Martell%2520%2526%2520Froese%25202012.pdf&amp;ei=PXryU6TtGY3goATglYHoDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNE-S0T1B7B_l7rUYaNNLxsUDguDaQ&amp;bvm=bv.73231344,d.cGU">Downloadable here</a></p> <p>Rosenberg, A.A., Fogarty, M.J., Cooper, A.B., Dickey-Collas, M., Fulton, E.A., Gutiérrez, N.L., Hyde, K.J.W., Kleisner, K.M., Kristiansen, T., Longo, C., Minte-Vera, C., Minto, C., Mosqueira, I., Chato Osio, G., Ovando, D., Selig, E.R., Thorson, J.T. &amp; Ye, Y.

The ‘tidy tools’ functions in the <code>dplyr</code> package work best with tidy data.</p> <p>From Hadley Wickham’s <a href="http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html"><em>Tidy Data</em> paper:</a> &gt;It is often said that 80% of data analysis is spent on the cleaning and preparing data. And it’s not just a first step, but it must be repeated many over the course of analysis as new problems come to light or new data is collected. To get a handle on the problem, this paper focuses on a small, but important, aspect of data cleaning that I call data tidying: structuring datasets to facilitate analysis.</p> <p>From <a href="http://blog.rstudio.org/2014/07/22/introducing-tidyr/">RStudio’s introduction to <code>tidyr</code></a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The two most important properties of tidy data are: 1. Each column is a variable. 2. Each row is an observation.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Arranging your data in this way makes it easier to work with because you have a consistent way of referring to variables (as column names) and observations (as row indices). When you use tidy data and tidy tools, you spend less time worrying about how to feed the output from one function into the input of another, and more time answering your questions about the data.</p> </blockquote> <p><code>gather()</code> is arguably the most useful function in <code>tidyr</code>, and is explained in more detail below. <code>spread()</code> and <code>separate()</code> are other useful functions in <code>tidyr</code>.</p> <p>Other ‘tidyr’ references: * <a href="http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html">Hadley Wickham’s <em>Tidy Data</em> paper:</a> Download the pre-print version for the whys and hows of tidy data. * <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html">Cran tidy data vignette:</a> An informal and code heavy version of Hadley’s full <em>Tidy Data</em> paper. * <a href="http://blog.rstudio.org/2014/07/22/introducing-tidyr/">RStudio Blogs: Introducing tidyr:</a> Basics and philosophy of <code>tidyr</code> * <a href="http://swirlstats.com/students.html">swirl tutorial package:</a> A tutorial package built directly into R.

Use <code>gather()</code> when your data is organized in “wide” format, in which some of your variables are in row form, rather than column form. Another <code>tidyr</code> function, <code>spread()</code>, is more or less the reverse of <code>gather()</code>, to reformat long data into wide data. It is more difficult to work with wide data, but may be more convenient for examining data in a table format.</p> <p>Note: <code>gather()</code> essentially replaces <code>melt()</code> in <code>plyr</code> package.</p> <p><strong>Example</strong></p> <p>The sample data set (see intro) contains harvest data of a number of marine commodities, separated by country, commodity, and year. In its original form, the harvest data (in tonnes) is spread across five different harvest years. * Counter to ‘tidy data’ principles, we have multiple columns (X2007:X2011) representing a single variable (year), and multiple observations of harvest tonnage in each row. * To transform this into ‘tidy data’ we will gather the five annual harvests into a single column called ‘tonnes’ and note the year of harvest in a new column called ‘year’.</p> <p>The example in the figure below shows how the original wide data is transformed into long data using the command <code>gather</code>. Here are two ways of acheiving this:</p> <ol style="list-style-type: decimal"> <li>Here, information from columns X2007 through X2011 are gathered into a single column called <code>year</code>, and the information in each column are put into a new column called <code>tonnes</code>.</li> </ol> <pre><code>data_long &lt;- data_wide %&gt;% gather(year, tonnes, X2007:X2011)</code></pre> <ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal"> <li>Here, the <code>-</code> unselects the named columns, so they will not be gathered; all other columns are gathered into columns named <code>year</code> and <code>tonnes</code>.

This lets you avoid creating temporary variables to store intermediate values, and lets you avoid nesting multiple functions. Using <code>%&gt;%</code> makes your code more elegant, streamlined, and easy to read since you are able to write your code on multiple indented lines. From <a href="http://seananderson.ca/2014/09/13/dplyr-intro.html"><code>dplyr</code> and pipes: the basics:</a></p> <blockquote> <p>OK, here’s where it gets cool. We can chain <code>dplyr</code> functions in succession. This lets us write data manipulation steps in the order we think of them and avoid creating temporary variables in the middle to capture the output. This works because the output from every <code>dplyr</code> function is a data frame and the first argument of every <code>dplyr</code> function is a data frame.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Usage</strong></p> <pre><code>data_out &lt;- f(data_in, args)   # standard function call  data_out &lt;- data_in %&gt;% f(args)   # function call using %&gt;% operator. data_in is passed as first argument   # of function().  data_out &lt;- data_in %&gt;%   f1(args1) %&gt;%   f2(args2) %&gt;%   f3(args3) %&gt;% ...   # Output of function can be passed to another function immediately,   # without need for temporary storage.

You can add new variables or modify existing variables, using all variety of functions to perform operations on the dataset. <code>mutate()</code> works well with <code>group_by()</code> to perform calculations and analysis at a group level rather than dataset level.</p> <p><strong>Example</strong></p> <p>From the sample data set (see figure below), we would like to:</p> <ul> <li>Remove the ‘X’ from the ‘year’ values.</li> <li>Translate the text codes in ‘tonnes’ into numbers and NAs. These codes are specific to FAO’s data reporting format: <code>...</code> is the same as <code>NA</code>, and <code>0 0</code> means greater than zero, but less than half a tonne.</li> <li>Convert these text fields into numeric fields so they can be analyzed properly.</li> </ul> <div class="figure"> <img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1LbBLBM7dI8TP8cCknT-VDqY-SW5ceBkfnkZUlftG8lo/pub?w=889&amp;h=297" alt="Using mutate to alter data in a dataframe" /><p class="caption">Using mutate to alter data in a dataframe</p> </div> <pre><code>library(stringr)   ### to access &#39;str_replace()&#39; string functions  harvest1 &lt;- harvest %&gt;%   mutate(       year   = str_replace(year,   fixed(&#39;X&#39;),    &#39;&#39;),  # remove the &#39;X&#39;     tonnes = str_replace(tonnes, fixed(&#39;...&#39;),  NA),  # replace &#39;...&#39; with &#39;NA&#39;     tonnes = str_replace(tonnes, fixed(&#39;0 0&#39;), 0.1),  # replace &#39;0 0&#39; with &#39;0.1&#39;     tonnes = ifelse(tonnes ==&#39;&#39;, NA, tonnes)) %&gt;%   mutate(     tonnes = as.numeric(as.character(tonnes)),     year   = as.integer(as.character(year)))</code></pre> <p>Notes: * In this example, no new variables were added. Multiple variables can be changed with one call to <code>mutate()</code>. Multiple modifications to ‘tonnes’ happen sequentially, so order is important. * The <code>as.numeric(as.character(...))</code> gets around the fact that these text variables are stored as ‘factor’ class, rather than ‘character’ class. <code>as.character()</code> forces them into character class, and then the <code>as.numeric()</code> can convert the character strings to numeric where applicable.

But once your dataset has been sorted into useful groups, other <code>dplyr</code> functions will operate on each group separately, rather than operating on the entire dataset. * The function <code>groups(data)</code> reports back the current grouping status of dataframe <code>data</code>.</p> <ul> <li><code>group_by()</code> alters the grouping, but does not alter the sort order.<br /><code>arrange()</code> does not alter the current grouping - it will sort by groups first, then sorts within each group.</li> <li>Multiple calls to <code>group_by()</code> will reset the groupings each time (by default), rather than adding additional layers of groups.</li> <li>Once you have finished with your operation at the group level, it is a good practice to use the <code>ungroup()</code> function to remove the groupings, to avoid unintended consequences due to forgotten <code>group_by()</code> calls.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Example</strong></p> <p>If you want to find the total tonnage harvested for each commodity for each country, you would want to group by country and by commodity, and then perform a <code>sum()</code> function on the grouped data.

This is especially true when you’re writing code with others. In that case, it’s a good idea to agree on a common style up-front.

For OHI+, we expect people to modify code to implement new goal models, and we may need to provide support in developing and debugging their code.</p> <p>Certain coding techniques are more efficient than others (e.g. in R, looping across elements in a vector is much slower than operating on the entire vector at once), but rarely does OHI code push any performance envelopes.

A few questions are related to general concepts in the Ocean Health Index, but mostly those topics are covered at <a href="http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/About/FAQ/" class="uri">http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/About/FAQ/</a>. Here, the FAQ are primarily technical questions regarding regional assessments and using the OHI Toolbox. This document will be updated continually as we have more questions. Questions are arranged by theme, and have the format Q: (question) and A: (answer).</p> <div id="overall" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">9.1</span> Overall</h2> </div> <div id="conceptual" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">9.2</span> Conceptual</h2> <p><strong>Q: Are regional assessment scores comparable with global assessment scores?</strong></p> <p>A: Regional Index scores cannot be directly compared to global Index scores, or to other regional Index scores calculated through separate efforts. This is because data and indicators (both what they measure and their quality), reference points (set using local knowledge and priorities), and specific goal models are often different for the areas being compared.</p> <p>However, because scores for each goal are scaled to a reference point, qualitative comparisons can be made. For example, a score of 71 in the US West Coast compared to 66 in Brazil says that the US West coast is closer to fully meeting its sustainable goals (i.e., meeting regional reference points). Furthermore, use of the same Ocean Health Index framework across regional assessments permits fruitful discussion and general comparisons even if data inputs differ. Ocean Health Index assessments at any scale always work within a standardized definition of ocean health, using information to capture the philosophy of the ten goals that have been identified (and undergone scientific peer-review) prior to compiling relevant data. Use of the ten-goal framework is important both to ensure that all aspects of ocean health are captured and to allow better comparison across regional assessments than would be possible if the different regions used different methods.</p> <p><strong>Q: How does the Index account for ecosystem benefits?</strong></p> <p>A: The OHI is not an index of ecosystem services. The Index prefers to describe benefits from a healthy ocean and emphasize their relevance, but the ideas are closely related. The ten goals roughly fall into areas of ecosystem services such as food provisioning (<strong>Food Provision</strong>), regulatory services (<strong>Carbon Storage</strong>), cultural services (<strong>Tourism and Recreation</strong>,<strong>Special Places</strong>), supporting services (<strong>Clean Waters</strong>, <strong>Biodiversity</strong>), and other values (<strong>Livelhoods and Economies</strong>).</p> <p><em>(Source: OHI Baltic workshop)</em></p> <p><strong>Q: Where is climate change measured in the Index?</strong></p> <p>A: Four different aspects of climate change – increases in sea surface temperature (SST), sea level rise (SLR), ultraviolet radiation (UV), and ocean acidification (OA) – are included as pressures to many goals in the Index, including Natural Products, Carbon Storage, Coastal Protection, Sense of Place, Livelihoods &amp; Economies and Biodiversity. Mitigation of climate change through carbon storage is one of the ten goals.</p> <p><strong>Q: Why are food provision and artisanal fishing opportunities goals separated?</strong></p> <p>A: These goals measure different aspects of how people relate to fishing. The catch of fish made by artisanal (=small-scale, subsistence type) fisheries is captured in the food provision goal. Jobs, wages and income from both the food provision and artisanal fishing goals are captured in the livelihoods &amp; economies goal. The purpose of the artisanal fishing opportunity goal is to evaluate the opportunity for people to pursue this fishing in relation to their need to do so.</p> </div> <div id="timing-and-resources" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">9.3</span> Timing and Resources</h2> <p><strong>Q: How much does it cost to produce a regional assessment?</strong></p> <p>A: Regional assessments can be completed at(varying costs depending on the local context.(Funds are needed for a management and scientific team, workshops and meetings (including travel), communications, policy engagement, and operating costs. Therefore, securing funding is an important component to satisfactorily complete the assessment. We encourage the development of a local proposal or strategic action plan that details a timeline of activities and the resources needed to accomplish them.</p> <p><strong>Q: How many people are required in a team?</strong></p> <p>A: rather than a specific number of individuals, what is required are specific skillsets. For example, if the scientific analysts were capable of effectively conducting the R analysis, then a dedicated R analyst would not be required. In current assessments, teams range between 2 and 8 people.</p> <p><strong>Q: How long does it take to calculate OHI at a regional scale?</strong></p> <p>A: The duration of an OHI assessment depends on a number of factors, such as the budget and number of people involved, the scale of the study area and whether new regions will need to be created, how easily data can be acquired, how much local data can be incorporated, how many goal models need to be changed. Additionally, decisions about setting reference points require input from experts. For independent assessments (OHI+), we have found that the average time has ranged from 1.5 to 3 years (See <strong>Task Timeline</strong> in the <strong>Conceptual Guide</strong>).</p> <p><strong>Q: How much time will modifications by an R analyst take?</strong></p> <p>A: This will depend on if you are changing any models, and potentially data layers–but a lot of changing data layers just requires registering them properly in <code>layers.csv</code> (and maybe <code>pressures_matrix.csv</code> and resilience_matrix.csv if they are pressures or resilience files) and having the <code>functions.R</code> file call those layers. That is more ‘bookkeeping’ than actual R programming.</p> <p><strong>Q: How much time will modifications by a GIS analyst take?</strong></p> <p>A: this will depend on how many layers you are processing: you are clipping spatial data? That will take some time because there are quite a few files, but maybe not too long since it is pretty small scale and once there is a clipping mask created I think you apply it to other files.</p> <p><strong>Q: Which goals require a GIS analyst?</strong></p> <p>A: All goals using spatial data could potentially require a GIS analyst. These goals are commonly: habitat-based goals and sub-goals: (Coastal Protection, Carbon Storage, Habitats—a sub-goal of Biodiversity), Food Provision, Sense of Place, Species—a sub-goal of Biodiversity, Clean Waters</p> </div> <div id="structure" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">9.4</span> Structure</h2> <p><strong>Q: Can we remove or add goals to the OHI?</strong></p> <p>A: A lot of deliberation went into defining the ten goals, and they seem to do a pretty good job of covering many if not most ocean uses, so additional goals may not be necessary. But it could be that they eclipse or replace an existing goal.</p> </div> <div id="reference-points" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">9.5</span> Reference points</h2> <p><strong>Q: Can planning targets can be used as the reference points?</strong></p> <p>A: Yes, planning targets can be used as reference points. This won’t be appropriate for every goal, but there are cases where this seemed best (example: iconic species sub-goal in the global assessment, mariculture sub-goal in the US West Coast assessment).</p> <p><strong>Q: What is sector evenness?</strong></p> <p>A: Sector evenness (also called a diversity index) is an economic concept that is included in OHI to enable comparison across many different sectors included in the Livelihoods &amp; Economies goal. This goal evaluates jobs, wages and revenues for nine marine employment sectors. The distribution of employment across these nine sectors is an effective indicator of resilience. If total employment within a community is primarily based in one or two sectors, the overall economic system will be excessively vulnerable to downturns in those sectors. Conversely, if employment is spread relatively evenly throughout all nine sectors, the overall system will be more robust and resistant to such disturbances. Overall revenue within the community will remain more stable during such downturns, and workers displaced by a downturn in their sector may be able to find employment in another sector without leaving the community.</p> </div> <div id="appropriate-data-layers" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">9.6</span> Appropriate data layers</h2> <p><strong>Q: Shipping and port activity are hardly affected by the health of the ecosystem. Why are these included in the Index?</strong></p> <p>A: Shipping and port activity are included as pressures only</p> <p><strong>Q: Can oil spills be included in OHI?</strong></p> <p>A: Yes, oil spills could be included as a pressure and in the Clean Waters goal.</p> <p><strong>Q: Is seasonal (non-permanent) sea ice included in OHI habitats?</strong></p> <p>A: No, sea ice only includes permanent sea ice.</p> <p><strong>Q: Can seaweeds be included in the Carbon Storage goal?</strong></p> <p>A: Because they store carbon for less than 100 years, seaweeds and corals are not included in the carbon storage goal. While the pelagic oceanic carbon sink (phytoplankton) plays a large role in the sequestration of anthropogenic carbon, the pelagic ocean mechanisms are not amenable to local or regional management intervention. Phytoplankton and contribute to carbon fixation when they die and sink to the sea bottom at sufficient depth, because it is effectively out of circulation. However, if those phytoplankton are eaten, the carbon is cycled back into the system and not sequestered. Something that could potentially be included in the carbon storage goal is mollusc shells, if they are added to a landfill and not recycled in the sea. So if information on mariculture production and waste disposal are available, this could be an interesting addition to carbon storage at a regional scale.</p> <p><strong>Q: Is coastal engineering included in Coastal Protection? What if it reduces erosion?</strong></p> <p>A: We did not include an assessment of the protection afforded by man-made structures, such as jetties and seawalls, because these structures cannot be preserved without maintenance, may have other negative side effects (e.g. alter sedimentation rates causing erosion in new locations), thus they do not constitute long-term sustainable services. Coastal engineering (jetties, harbours, marina and breakwater) is not natural, and is mostly seen as a pressure. It will also be evident in the status of due to decreased natural habitat. It gets tricky when structures are built to help reduce coastal erosion–they are still manmade and therefore not a natural benefit that the ocean provides. But if available data allow, it might be possible to include tradeoff effects: maybe in areas where natural habitats are degraded and man-made structures have been built to reduce erosion, we could reduce the pressure that would otherwise be applied.</p> <p><strong>Q: How is seawater used for cooling on-shore power plants incorporated into OHI?</strong></p> <p>A: The use of cooling water for on-shore power plants would be a pressure on the ocean, since it causes entrapment of fishes, larvae, etc, and usually is circulated back into the ocean at higher temperatures (and maybe other chemicals, minerals, etc). Since the energy is coming from land-based activities, there isn’t a service that the ocean is providing that ‘benefits’ people, it is only a pressure from the OHI perspective.</p> <p><strong>Q: How is freshwater production through desalination incorporated into OHI?</strong></p> <p>A: Desal would be incorporated into OHI in several places. The benefit is that there is freshwater produced, which could be incorporated into the Natural Products goal (or potentially into its own goal). Data required would be the volume of freshwater created based on the volume of seawater involved and spatial extent. Setting the reference point would not be based on how much can be produced, but some other targets perhaps set by government (percentage of the population served). Similar to the mariculture sub-goal and tourism goals, any negative effects caused by desal that affect other goals (example: species) do not influence the ability to obtain desalination targets now and in the future. Therefore, the sustainability coefficient only measures the ability to sustain that goal, but not the impacts on other goals: instead, they are taken into account as pressures when calculating the other goals. Desal should be included as a pressure similar to cooling on-shore power plants since the discharge brine is dense, doesn’t plume very well and there are chemicals involved.</p> <p><strong>Q: Where do energy activities fit in to OHI?</strong></p> <p>It depends. Energy could be part of a <strong>Natural Products</strong> goal, for instance, such as wave energy – but then the question is, what is the reference point? It is partially accounted for in <strong>Livelihoods &amp; Economies</strong> through sectoral jobs data. The infrastructure is also something to consider. It could also be a pressure or resilience factor if there is a measurable footprint of the activity. You may want to consider for resilience, do you have governance measures that promote more sustainable practices in the energy industry?</p> <!---From Baltic Discussion 2015---> </div> <div id="food-provision" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">9.7</span> Food Provision</h2> <p><strong>Q: Could the culture of marine fish in closed pools on-shore be included in the Mariculture sub-goal?</strong></p> <p>A: This should not be included because onshore aquaculture does not require a marine environment.</p> <p><strong>Q: Can aquaculture farms that receive seawater supply and return seawater back to the sea be included in the food provision goal?</strong></p> <p>A: This would be more appropriately included in the Mariculture sub-goal, and with finer-scale data additional pressures due to the intake pipes and the processed brine back into the marine system could be incorporated as well. Natural Products</p> <p><strong>Q: If natural products are all produced through on-land aquaculture, should this goal be removed?</strong></p> <p>A: In this case you would probably have good reason to exclude the natural product goal due if this was defendable through discussions with experts and any reports/papers on the topic. This would also depend on the origin of these natural products–are they from the region’s waters? Habitat-based goals</p> <p>**Q: I have fish that are used as feed for other fish (e.g., sprat) in my country. Can I include them in this goal?</p> <p>A: It would be more appropriate to include them in Natural Products rather than Food Provision. This is because they are not being consumed directly. Fish such as sprat, for example, may be used to feed pigs in addition to other fish, and therefore you would need to know how much (tonnage) is being produced, and where it is going to be able to accurately distinguish these categories to avoid double-counting.</p> <p><em>(Source: OHI Baltic Workshop, February 2015)</em></p> <p><strong>Q: How is coral health calculated?</strong></p> <p>A: Coral health was estimated by compiling point data from multiple studies of percent live coral cover. In other words, estimates of coral cover within transects of certain sites were repeated in time and we used that rate of change in time as an indication of health of the reefs in the whole region. The difficulty lies in 1) having enough different locations sampled that you can say something about the whole region and 2) finding studies that did repeated measures in time, in the same location, over at least 20 years. In the Global 2013 assessment, there were so few datasets that satisfied this condition that we had to pool observations from different locations.</p> <p><strong>Q: Is it possible to calculate habitat goals when there is only one year of habitat data?</strong></p> <p>A: With only one year of habitat data, it is not possible to calculate the trend (which requires 5 years of data). Instead, it might be best to use the available habitat data to calculate the current status and then to overlay pressures for the last 5 years to calculate trend.</p> </div> <div id="livelihoods-economies" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">9.8</span> Livelihoods &amp; Economies</h2> <p><strong>Q: Benefits gained from Wild-caught fisheries, Mariculture, Tourism &amp; Recreation are included in specific goals. Why are these counted again in Livelihoods &amp; Economies?</strong></p> <p>A: The quantity of fish, mariculature, and participation in T&amp;R are considered separately in goals whereas the monetary component is captured in L&amp;E.</p> <p><strong>Q: Why are revenue data from shipping, boat building, ports and harbors included as revenue? Do these activities rely on a healthy ocean?</strong></p> <p>A: These sectors are included in the Ocean Health Index because the demand for some of those boats (fishing boats, sailboats, yachts) is dependent on a healthy ocean.</p> <p><strong>Q: Why isn’t oil and gas industries included in revenue?</strong></p> <p>A: The Natural Products goal does not include non-living items such as oil, gas, and mining products, because these practices are not considered to be sustainable. They are also done at such large scales that including them would essentially make OHI an index for oil and mining–and they are not truly an ocean product. Because these products are not included in terms of quantity extracted, it did not seem appropriate to include information regarding jobs, wages or revenue.</p> </div> <div id="tourism-recreation" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">9.9</span> Tourism &amp; Recreation</h2> <p><strong>Q: How do I calculate the sustainability term for TR?</strong></p> <p>A: The best way is to use a local indicator or measure of tourism sustainability or competitiveness, otherwise use the TTCI value from the Global 2013 assessment for the study area (applied evenly across all regions.</p> </div> <div id="natural-products" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">9.10</span> Natural Products</h2> <p><strong>Q: Where do Natural Products come from?</strong></p> <p>A: In the global assessments, Natural Products data come from the UN’s Food and Agriculture Administration (www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/software/fishstatj/en). These data are compiled and reported by product for each country, and available by downloading the FishStatJ software.</p> </div> <div id="species" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">9.11</span> Species</h2> <p><strong>Q: Can species and iconic species model scores be penalized if there are local flagship species that have not been evaluated?</strong></p> <p>Global data are based on IUCN assessments. For these evaluations, IUCN chooses a taxon (e.g. sharks) and a group of world experts assess it comprehensively. Locally identified species identified in a regional assessment may not be in the IUCN database because they do not belong to one of the taxa that have been selected for assessment, or because the experts that did the assessment did not know that information existed. In either case, there is no connection between what IUCN reports and what assessments are done locally. Therefore, it might not be fair to penalize a study area for missing species. For biodiversity, it is unrealistic to expect that all species are assessed, so it seems unfair to penalize for unassessed species. In the fisheries goal, there are penalties for species that are exploited but not assessed, because if there are landings data, it means they are somewhat measurable, and so it is reasonable to expect they should be at least monitored.</p> <p>It might be reasonable to penalize unassessed iconic species. It is a smaller list of species that are specifically identified as being of interest, for one reason or other. This would work for species that have some form of assessment - unless that information already exists, it might be unrealistic to try to produce the data layer required to develop a new model.</p> </div> <div id="sense-of-place" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">9.12</span> Sense of Place</h2> <p><strong>Q: Data are only available for marine protected areas, not terrestrial protected areas. Can we still calculate the Lasting Special Places sub-goal?</strong></p> <p>A: Yes, it is possible to calculate only the marine component of this sub-goal: this is not ideal but OHI is flexible to work with the data available.</p> <p><strong>Q: Should we calculate each category used in our assessment (e.g., antiquities, MPAs, beaches of special interest) independently, and then give the same weight (e.g., a third of the goal score) to the three categories, or should we instead pool the actual areas of the 3 categories?</strong></p> <p>A: Whether you group them together or calculate each category separately depends on reference points. Maybe you want 10% of offshore water to be in MPAs, but only 5% of coastlines to be beaches and 3% Antiquities, for example; in this case, you would calculate them separately and then add them together. But if you want 10% of your country’s coast to have any combination of these things, you would keep them together.</p> <p><em>(Source: OHI Israel assessment discussions, 2014-2015)</em></p> </div> <div id="pressures" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">9.13</span> Pressures</h2> <p><strong>Q: How are single ecological pressures (si in Equation S8) calculated?</strong></p> <p>A: Data included in pressures calculations are accessed in the same manner as any other data layer, and rescaled from 0-1 with an appropriate reference point. For further information, see HowTo_GatherAppropriateData and HowTo_CalculatePressures from ohi-science.org.</p> <p><strong>Q: Does the pressures matrix need to be changed?</strong></p> <p>A: It is likely that the pressures matrix will not need to be changed. The weights assigned in the matrix were set using information from the literature and by experts; the matrix was created by Halpern et al. 2012.</p> <p><strong>Q: How is commercial high and low bycatch calculated?</strong></p> <p>A: Commercial high and low bycatch are categorical values that were set based on fishing gear type. This began as a list of gear types used, producing a range of potential bycatch frequencies (from local reports when possible), which can be rescaled.</p> </div> </div>   </div>  <script>  // add bootstrap table styles to pandoc tables $(document).ready(function () {   $('tr.header').parent('thead').parent('table').addClass('table table-condensed'); });  </script>  <!-- dynamically load mathjax for compatibility with self-contained --> <script>   (function () {     var script = document.createElement("script");     script.type = "text/javascript";     script.src  = "https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML";     document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(script);   })(); </script>  </body> </html>
