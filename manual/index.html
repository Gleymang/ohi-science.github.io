Introduction</h1> <div id="the-ocean-health-index" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> The Ocean Health Index</h2> <p><strong>The Ocean Health Index (OHI)</strong> project was created with a strong foundation in communication and collaboration. Following the initial publication by Halpern <em>et al</em>. 2012 in <em>Nature</em>, we have conducted global assessments annually (in 2013, 2014, and ongoing), and have conducted smaller-scale assessments for the U.S. West Coast (Halpern <em>et al.</em> 2014), Fiji (Selig <em>et al.</em> in press), and Brazil (Elfes <em>et al.</em> 2014).</p> <p>We have also developed the <strong>OHI Toolbox</strong> and <strong>WebApps</strong> to enable any group to conduct independent assessments using the OHI framework and modifying it to their needs. The Toolbox enables the OHI framework to be customized to any area of interest, incorporating whatever goals, data, indicators, and priorities regarding ocean-derived benefits that are relevant and available to the chosen spatial scale. Information is presented through the WebApps, which are used for orientation, visualization, and reporting.</p> <p>This manual provides information for:</p> <ol style="list-style-type: decimal"> <li>Planning an assessment</li> <li>Navigating the OHI WebApp to visualize data at global and regional scales</li> <li>Modifying data and models within the Toolbox for an independent assessment</li> <li>Guidance for frequently asked questions and troubleshooting</li> </ol> </div> </div> <div id="introduction-to-ohi-assessments" class="section level1"> <h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Introduction to OHI Assessments</h1> <p>Assessments using the OHI framework can be most relevant to policy and management decisions when they are conducted at smaller spatial scales (e.g., countries, states, provinces, ecoregions, bays, etc.). Using ten criteria (called goals), the Index scores on a scale of 0 to 100 how well coastal regions optimize their potential ocean benefits and services in a sustainable way relative to self-established reference points (targets). Relevant goal models are developed based on the best available information, which can be either raw data or composite data, or previously developed indicators.</p> <p><strong>The process of conducting an OHI assessment is as valuable as the final results.</strong> This is because while conducting an OHI assessment you will identify gaps in knowledge and data, produce decision-relevant information, and create an ocean alliance that combines knowledge and cultural values across disciplines. Conducting an OHI assessment requires engagement from as many different groups as possible, including research institutions, government agencies, policy groups, non-governmental organizations, and the civil and private sectors.</p> <p>Assessments can incorporate higher-resolution data and indicators, local priorities and preferences, and develop tailored goal models and reference points, which produce scores that better reflect local realities. If a goal is not relevant in the local context, it can be excluded entirely. Similarly, pressures and resilience measures can be refined using local data and indicators. Index scores are only as good as the data on which they are based. <strong>Finding the best data and indicators available is crucial for obtaining meaningful findings that can help inform decision-making.</strong></p> <p>OHI assessments most often involve several <strong>regions</strong> within an overall <strong>study area</strong>. For example, in the global assessment, there were 221 regions (nations and territories) within the study area (global coastal oceans).</p> <div class="figure"> <img src="fig/global_v_brazil_map.png" /> </div> <p>Goal scores are calculated for each region separately and then combined to produce an overall Index score for the region. Index scores are combined using an area-weighted average to produce the Index score for the overall study area.</p> </div> <div id="overview-of-the-ohi-toolbox-app" class="section level1"> <h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Overview of the OHI Toolbox App</h1> <div id="background" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Background</h2> <p><strong>OHI WebApps</strong> are websites created to facilitate independent assessments, and one is available for nearly every coastal nation or territory: they are a ‘Starter Kit’. WebApps are available through <a href="http://ohi-science.org">http://ohi-science.org</a> with a three-letter identifier. For example, Ecuador’s WebApp is found at <a href="http://ohi-science.org/ecu">http://ohi-science.org/ecu</a>. Each WebApp displays raw data layers* and calculated OHI scores based on information extracted from global assessments. As such, they do not provide fine-scale resolution of data for each coastal nation or territory: the scores and data on which they are based are a starting point for an assessment to be conducted by an independent group. These data can be used as a default if better data for the region do not exist, but we encourage you to replace them wherever possible. (*Note: each data component that is included in the OHI is called a <strong>data layer</strong> because it will be combined with others to calculate the goal scores. Many data layers are rescaled from 0-1 to be combined with others on the same unitless scale.)</p> <p>Boundaries for exclusive economic zones (EEZs) were identified by www.marineregions.org and the largest subcountry regions (i.e. provinces, states, districts) were identified by gadm.org. Subcountry region boundaries were extended offshore to divide the EEZ of each study area into offshore regions. These subcountry regions have been provided as a starting point, and are typically coastal states or provinces, which, in our experience, is consistent with the scale at which most policy decisions are made. However, it is possible to change the boundaries for the regions and the study area depending on your preferences.</p> <p>OHI WebApps serve several purposes because they:</p> <ol style="list-style-type: decimal"> <li>allow for exploration of how the Index works: what data look like and which data are used in each goal</li> <li>are a communication platform for an assessment team, since information is presented in a manner that is accessible to group members of different disciplines and technical capacities</li> <li>can be used to set data gathering or goal model development priorities for the assessment</li> <li>display your assessment’s data and calculated scores once you have finalized and formatted your data and modified goal models.</li> </ol> <p>The information displayed on the website is stored online, in a <strong>GitHub repository.</strong> GitHub is an open-source development platform allows for multiple users to collaborate, track changes, and document work such as data files and code. Therefore, any changes made to the files contained within the GitHub repository will be displayed on the WebApp for all team members to view. See below for how to modify files using GitHub.</p> </div> <div id="using-the-webapp" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Using the WebApp</h2> <p>When first exploring a WebApp (for example, <a href="http://ohi-science.org/ecu">http://ohi-science.org/ecu</a>), first note that it is possible to <strong>translate</strong> the site into any language that Google provides using the pull-down menu at the top.</p> <div class="figure"> <img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/11Gojqw0Xz4kUo_uM1Y699EKO3qN_dae0w93ICzXJ2Pg/pub?w=960&amp;h=720" /> </div> <p>The WebApp homepage provides several tabs for you to explore. The interactive <strong>App</strong> allows you to explore input data layers and output calculated scores for each region, and is explained fully in the following section. More detailed information is about the default <strong>regions</strong> and <strong>data layers</strong>, <strong>goal models</strong>, and <strong>calculated scores</strong> based on global data can be viewed in separate tabs, as well as through the App. A quick reference about navigating the WebApp is available through the <strong>Docs</strong> tab. When your team has finalized data layers and updated goal models, these data and scores will be visualized through the WebApp.</p> </div> <div id="the-app" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> The App</h2> <p>The App allows you to explore and visualize input data layers and calculated output scores for each region in the study area. By default, global data are presented for each subcountry region in the study area, and scores are calculated for each region using those data.</p> <p>The App displays this information through two tabs: Data and Compare. The <strong>Data</strong> tab provides several subtabs for viewing data (<em>Map</em>, <em>Histogram</em>, <em>Table</em>), and is the default tab when the Toolbox is launched. The <strong>Compare</strong> tab is most useful for comparing output scores when modifications are made to the underlying data or models (this provides a way to error check) once you have begun the process of calculating your own assessment.</p> <p>The App provides two Branch/Scenario options to view, identified in the upper-left corner of the Data tab. The <strong>Branch</strong> options refer to the versions of the GitHub repository where data are stored. Branches start off as copies of the same repository, but can be modified independently of each other, enabling progress to be made on one (‘draft’ branch) while not altering the vetted original (‘published’ branch). These branches can be merged back together at any time. The App will display the ‘published branch’ by default; we recommend working on the ‘draft’ branch until your assessment is finalized, at which point you would merge the draft branch with the published branch.</p> <p><strong>Scenario</strong> folders contain all the files needed to calculate scores. Scenario folders can differ from each other based on the years included (i.e. 2014 would be a different scenario from 2015), or they can be used to explore outcomes of policy alternatives, such as implementation of a proposed Marine Protected Area network or fisheries regulations.</p> </div> <div id="the-apps-data-tab" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> The App’s Data tab</h2> <div id="overview-of-display-options" class="section level3"> <h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.1</span> Overview of display options</h3> <p>The Data tab displays input data or calculated scores for each goal parameter, and presents the information as a map, histogram, or table. These options (<em>Map</em>, <em>Histogram</em>, <em>Table</em>) are presented as subtabs located the map. The Map subtab is the default display option for the Data tab, and all data presented is based on data from global assessments.</p> <p><strong>Data displayed in the Map subtab:</strong></p> <div class="figure"> <img src="fig/datapage_view.png" /> </div> <p>The map displays data for every region as reported in the scenario.

As described above, most coastal countries have a WebApp that was created to facilitate planning and communication during your assessment. The WebApp presents data, goal models and calculated scores for each region (global administrative area identified by gadm.org) visually through maps, histograms, and tables. All data presented were extracted from the global analysis, and scores were calculated using global goal models. For a finer-scale assessment of ocean health in your region, these data files provided will need to be updated with available data and indicators for each region in your assessment. However, if better data are not available, you can use the data provided. Then, to dive deeper into data layers and goal models, you can explore your assessment’s GitHub repository, which stores all the information presented through the WebApp.</p> <p>You should also be familiar with the approaches taken by other assessments adapted from the global context, including Brazil, the US West Coast, and Fiji. You can find these studies at ohi-science.org.</p> <p>While our team of scientists and managers is prepared to provide guidance for assessments, you should follow the steps in this training program to complete your assessment as autonomously as possible.</p> </div> <div id="points-to-remember" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Points to remember</h2> <p>We recommend keeping in mind the following as you develop your approach:</p> <ul> <li>People are part of ocean health <ul> <li>economic and social data are included in OHI: consider how people are locally engaging with the ocean</li> </ul></li> <li>Goal models should be modified to capture local characteristics and priorities that can be measured with available data <ul> <li>after identifying what is important locally, identify direct or indirect measures to develop tailored goal models<br /></li> </ul></li> <li>Assessments can use a mix of regional-, country- and global-scale data <ul> <li>include the finest-scale data available, but when this is not possible, rely on global-scale data</li> </ul></li> <li>Scores are calculated by region and then aggregated to the study area <ul> <li>comparing scores between regions is a primary reason for conducting a independent assessment</li> <li>goal models and data layers are the same across all regions; data values will vary by region.

For example: how the data and models are used to calculate the ten goals (and, in some cases, corresponding subgoals) for each region and how these are combined to generate an overall score for each region can be explored with the Toolbox. At this point, the Toolbox provides a guideline for the data that must be collected and how it should be organized.</p> <p>When going through the checklist remember too that a motivation for conducting an assessment is to be able to modify goal models and set reference points using finer-scale, local information and reference points.</p> <p>The following list of tasks will not necessarily be accomplished in sequence: there is a lot of iteration of tasks as you discover data, develop reference points and models, and revisit other data possibilities.

A hallmark of the OHI is that it uses freely-available data to create models that capture the philosophy of individual goals, and finding appropriate data requires research and creativity. There are many decisions to make when gathering from disparate sources, deciding reference points, and developing goal models.</p> <p><strong>Index scores are a reflection of data quality, and thus accessing the best data and indicators available is of highest importance</strong>.</p> <div id="data-sources" class="section level3"> <h3><span class="header-section-number">4.7.1</span> Data sources</h3> <p>Existing data and indicators can be gathered from many sources across environmental, social, and economic disciplines, including:</p> <ul> <li>government reports</li> <li>government websites</li> <li>academic literature</li> <li>masters and PhD theses</li> <li>university websites</li> <li>non-profit organizations</li> </ul> <p>All data will be rescaled to specific reference points (targets) before being combined; therefore setting these reference points at the appropriate scale is a fundamental component of any OHI assessment. This requires the regional assessment team to interpret the philosophy of each Index goal and sub-goal using the best available data and indicators.</p> </div> <div id="data-gathering-responsibilities" class="section level3"> <h3><span class="header-section-number">4.7.2</span> Data gathering responsibilities</h3> <p>Gathering appropriate data requires searching for and accessing freely-available data. It is important that team members responsible for data discovery make thoughtful decisions about whether data are appropriate for the regional assessment, and that they also get feedback from the full team to discuss the merits of different data sources. Data discovery and acquisition can be quite an iterative process, as there are both practical and philosophical reasons for including or excluding data, in addition to requiring access to the data.</p> <p>Index scores can be recalculated annually as new data become available. This can establish a baseline of ocean health and serve as a monitoring mechanism to evaluate the effectiveness of actions and policies in improving the status of overall ocean health. This is good to keep in mind while looking for data: will it be available again in the future? It is also important to document the sources of all data so that it is both transparent where it came from and so that you will be able to find it again in the future.</p> </div> <div id="the-process-of-data-discovery" class="section level3"> <h3><span class="header-section-number">4.7.3</span> The process of data discovery</h3> <p>In terms of philosophical considerations, the most important thing to remember when gathering data is that the data must contribute to measuring ocean health. Many data sources that enhance our knowledge of marine processes may not directly convey information about ocean health and may not be appropriate within the OHI framework. Because of this, compiled indicators can sometimes be more suitable than would raw data measuring single marine attributes.</p> <p>Begin by understanding and comparing the best approaches used in assessments that have been completed, including global assessments, Brazil, and the US West Coast. If finer-resolution local data were available in the study area, they could be used either in a newly developed regional goal model using locally appropriate and informed approaches, or in the existing global goal model. When local data were not available, the same global-scale data were used with the original global goal model, which is least desirable because it does not provide more information than the global study. When looking for data, the following decision tree may be useful. This should be a goal-by-goal process:</p> <div class="figure"> <img src="fig/data_discovery.png" /> </div> <p>Searching for data requires exploring data sources beyond any single discipline, and a good place to start is with an internet search. Internet searches can lead to published data in government and non-governmental organization reports, peer-reviewed articles, and masters and doctoral dissertations. Not everything will be freely available online but it is sometimes possible to request access.</p> <p>It is good practice to keep detailed notes of attributes of each potential data layer, since there may be different options to work with.

Determining whether certain data could be included started with a good understanding of the data layers and models included in the global assessment, and because the US West Coast is a data-rich region, finer-resolution local data could be used in place of many of the global data layers.</p> <div id="reasons-data-were-excluded" class="section level4"> <h4><span class="header-section-number">4.7.6.1</span> Reasons data were excluded</h4> <p>There are a lot of existing data that contribute to our scientific understanding of ocean processes and interactions but that are not ideal for the OHI. Reasons to exclude data occur both on a practical level (do data adhere to the requirements above?) and on a philosophical level, which requires reflecting on the relationship with ocean health. Some common reasons for excluding data are listed below:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>The data do not cover the entire area of the reporting region</strong>. The state of California had excellent, long-term data on public attendance at state parks that would have been quite useful in the calculation of the tourism and recreation goal. However, Oregon and Washington did not have these same data so they were not used.</p></li> <li><p><strong>There is not a clear and scientifically proven connection between the metric described by the data and ocean health</strong>. Along the US West Coast, kelp beds are a very important habitat because of their contribution to biodiversity and coastal protection. However, kelp coverage is quite variable and is driven primarily by abiotic natural forcing (wave/storm disturbance and temperature) and thus kelp coverage is not a good metric of ecosystem health. For these reasons kelp coverage was not included in the assessment.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The feature being measured may provide benefits to people, but this feature is not derived from the ocean</strong>. Sea walls and riprap provide coastal protection to many people along the US West Coast. However, these structures are not a benefit that is derived from the ocean itself, so only biogenic habitats were included in the calculation of this goal. These data can be included as a pressure due to habitat loss.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Data collection is biased and might misrepresent ocean health</strong>. The US Endangered Species Act identifies a species list focused on species of concern within the US. As such, these data are biased in the context of ocaean health since they assess only species whose populations may be in danger. For the calculation of the biodiversity goal, using these data would be inappropriate because this goal represents the status of all species in the region, not just those that are currently of conservation concern. Using these data may have shown the status of biodiversity to be lower than it really is because the selection of species to assess was already biased towards species of concern.</p></li> </ul> </div> <div id="creative-approaches-to-using-data" class="section level4"> <h4><span class="header-section-number">4.7.6.2</span> Creative approaches to using data</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Time series data are not long enough to calculate a trend or a reference point (when a historical reference point is most appropriate)</strong>. For the US West Coast, available data measure the current extent of seagrass habitats, however, these only exist for one time point in most areas so could not be used to calculate the trend or set a historical reference point. As these were the best data available for habitat coverage, we built a model to calculate the status and trend of seagrass habitats using other data that were available over time. A reasonable approach was to model the pressures exerted on seagrasses over time as a proxy for seagrass health.</li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> <div id="updating-pressures-and-resilience" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">4.8</span> Updating pressures and resilience</h2> <div id="introduction-1" class="section level3"> <h3><span class="header-section-number">4.8.1</span> Introduction</h3> <p>‘Pressures’ and ‘Resilience’ are two of the four dimensions with which each goal/sub-goal is evaluated (the other two are ‘Present Status’ and ‘Future Trend’).</p> <ul> <li><strong>Pressures</strong> are the sum of the ecological and social pressures that negatively affect goal scores.</li> <li><strong>Resilience</strong> is the sum of the ecological factors and social initiatives (policies, laws, etc) that can positively affect goal scores by reducing or eliminating pressures.</li> </ul> <div class="figure"> <img src="fig/calculating_index.png" /> </div> <p>For more general information on how OHI scores are calculated, see: <a href="http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/About/Methods/">http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/About/Methods/</a>.</p> <p><strong>Updating the pressure and resilience matrix for a new regional assessment will require the user to:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Understand the pressures and resilience measures included in completed global assessment and determine whether they are relevant locally.</li> <li>Identify and categorize new local pressures not captured in the pressures matrix.</li> <li>Identify and categorize new local resilience measures (laws, regulations) not captured in the resilience matrix.</li> <li>Set pressure and resilience weighting/ranking based on scientific literature and expert opinions.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Before updating the pressure and resilience matrices however, please also consider the following:</strong></p> <p>The Ocean Health Index framework calculates pressures by first grouping them into five ecological categories (pollution, habitat destruction, fishing pressure, species pollution, and climate change) and one social category. The reason behind the ecological categories was largely due to data availability at the global level and was designed to minimize sampling bias. For example, we found that there was more pollution data available than habitat destruction data, but just because people have monitored pollution more does not mean it is a larger pressure than habitat destruction. Ecologial and social pressures are assessed separately and then combined with equal weighting, which could be changed if there is local information on how to do so.</p> <p>Ecological and social resilience are similarly assessed separately and then combined with equal weighting, which could also be changed based on expert opinions. Any new resilience measure must be associated with a pressure layer. This is because resilience in the Ocean Health Index framework acts to reduce pressures in each region. Therefore, resilience measures must not only be directly or indirectly relevant to ocean health, but must be in response to a pressure layer affecting a goal.</p> <p>Note that goals often interact with each other through pressures. The pressure created by one goal may affect a second goal without being affected itself. For example, raising fish in the mariculture goal can cause genetic escapes, which is a pressure (the <em>sp_genetic</em> layer). This pressure affects only the wild-caught fisheries and species sub-goals, but does not affect mariculture itself.</p> </div> <div id="explore-local-pressures" class="section level3"> <h3><span class="header-section-number">4.8.2</span> Explore local pressures</h3> <p>Begin by exploring the pressures included in the global pressures matrix in the GitHub repository (<code>subcountry2014/conf/pressures_matrix.csv</code>; more on the filesystem below). As illustrated below, pressures are either ecological or social, and are grouped into 6 categories: pollution, habitat destruction, fishing pressure, species pollution, climate change, and social pressures.</p> <p>In the example below, the clean waters goal is affected by four data layers within the pollution category, as well as one in the social category.</p> <div class="figure"> <img src="fig/pressure_categories.png" /> </div> <p>Pressures (columns in <code>subcountry2014/conf/pressures_matrix.csv</code>), are matched with different goals and subgoals (rows) to indicate which pressures will be included when goal scores are calculated. In some cases the goals are further divided into components (e.g. habitats are divided by habitat type, natural products by product type).</p> <p>The first step in updating the pressures matrix for your regional assessment is to determine if there any pressures that should be excluded from your study? For example, if there is no mariculture in your study area, perhaps there are also no genetic escapes (<em>sp_genetic</em> layer).</p> <p>Next, brainstorm local pressures that are not captured in <code>pressures_matrix.csv</code>. Which pressures stand out in your study area? Pressures included in the <code>pressures_matrix.csv</code> are ultimately determined by available data, and thus there were pressures that were important but could not be included in the global assessment because of data availability (including altered sediment regimes, noise and light pollution, toxic chemicals from point sources, and nutrient pollution from atmospheric deposition and land-based sources other than fertilizer application to agricultural land). There are likely pressures important to your study area that were not captured in the global pressures matrix.</p> <p><strong>Table of pressures layers and descriptions</strong></p> <table> <thead> <tr class="header"> <th align="left">layer</th> <th align="left">name</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr class="odd"> <td align="left">cc_acid</td> <td align="left">Ocean acidification</td> </tr> <tr class="even"> <td align="left">cc_slr</td> <td align="left">Sea level rise</td> </tr> <tr class="odd"> <td align="left">cc_sst</td> <td align="left">Sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies</td> </tr> <tr class="even"> <td align="left">cc_uv</td> <td align="left">UV radiation</td> </tr> <tr class="odd"> <td align="left">fp_art_hb</td> <td align="left">High bycatch caused by artisanal fishing</td> </tr> <tr class="even"> <td align="left">fp_art_lb</td> <td align="left">Low bycatch caused by artisanal fishing</td> </tr> <tr class="odd"> <td align="left">fp_com_hb</td> <td align="left">High bycatch caused by commercial fishing</td> </tr> <tr class="even"> <td align="left">fp_com_lb</td> <td align="left">Low bycatch caused by commercial fishing</td> </tr> <tr class="odd"> <td align="left">fp_targetharvest</td> <td align="left">Targeted harvest of cetaceans and sea turtles</td> </tr> <tr class="even"> <td align="left">hd_intertidal</td> <td align="left">Coastal population density as a proxy for intertidal habitat destruction</td> </tr> <tr class="odd"> <td align="left">hd_subtidal_hb</td> <td align="left">High bycatch artisanal fishing practices as a proxy for subtidal hard bottom habitat destruction</td> </tr> <tr class="even"> <td align="left">hd_subtidal_sb</td> <td align="left">High bycatch commercial fishing practices as a proxy for subtidal soft bottom habitat destruction</td> </tr> <tr class="odd"> <td align="left">po_chemicals_3nm</td> <td align="left">Land-based chemical pollution</td> </tr> <tr class="even"> <td align="left">po_nutrients_3nm</td> <td align="left">Coastal nutrient pollution</td> </tr> <tr class="odd"> <td align="left">sp_alien</td> <td align="left">Alien species</td> </tr> <tr class="even"> <td align="left">sp_genetic</td> <td align="left">Introduced species as a proxy for genetic escapes</td> </tr> <tr class="odd"> <td align="left">ss_wgi</td> <td align="left">Weakness of governance indicated with the WGI</td> </tr> <tr class="even"> <td align="left">po_chemicals</td> <td align="left">Ocean-based chemical pollution</td> </tr> <tr class="odd"> <td align="left">po_nutrients</td> <td align="left">Ocean nutrient pollution</td> </tr> <tr class="even"> <td align="left">po_pathogens</td> <td align="left">Access to improved sanitation as a proxy for pathogen pollution</td> </tr> <tr class="odd"> <td align="left">po_trash</td> <td align="left">Trash pollution</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><strong>Some background</strong> on the reasoning behind nutrient and chemical pollution in the global <code>pressures_matrix.csv</code>: Nutrient and chemical pollution were calculated from the global cumulative impact maps (spatial data).

So <code>po_chemicals_3nm</code> applies to goals nearshore: AO, CS, CP, TR, ICO, LSP, HAB.</li> </ul> <p>These distinctions don’t always apply for smaller-scale assessments. For example, in the US West Coast study (Halpern et al. 2014), only a single <code>po_chemicals</code> layer was used: we did not distinguish between offshore and 3nm.</p> </div> <div id="determine-how-the-pressure-affects-goals" class="section level3"> <h3><span class="header-section-number">4.8.3</span> Determine how the pressure affects goals</h3> <p>Next, you will need to:</p> <ul> <li>Map which goals are affected by a given pressure layer.</li> <li>Determine the appropriate rank weighting (how important the pressure is for the delivery of the goal/component).</li> <li>Decide in which pressure category the new pressure belongs.</li> </ul> <p>These decisions should depend on expert opinions and previous scientific studies, even if they do not occur in your study area.</p> <p>The original pressure matrix weights for instance were determined by Halpern <em>et al</em>. 2012 (<em>Nature</em>) based on scientific literature and expert opinion (3=high, 2=medium, and 1=low pressure; stressors that have no impact drop out rather than being assigned a rank of zero, which would affect the average score). Pressures are ranked rather than being represented as a binary (yes/no) measure because the range of consequence of different pressures on each goal can be quite large, and to classify all those pressures as a simple ‘yes’ would unduly give too much influence to the weakest stressors. For example, food provision is most heavily impacted by unsustainable, high-bycatch fishing, but pollution does have some impact on fish stocks. Without a weighting system, these stressors would be treated equally in their impact on the food provision goal.</p> <p>Most likely, the new pressure will fit into one of the existing categories.

Data layers (data input) each have their own .csv file that are combined within the Toolbox in model calculations. These data layers are used for calculating goal scores, meaning that they are inputs for status, trend, pressures, and resilience. In the global analysis, there were over 100 data layer files included, and there will be nearly as many in regional applications, no matter what the spatial scale. This document describes and provides examples of how to format data for the Toolbox App.</p> <p>Ocean Health Index goal scores are calculated at the scale of the reporting unit, which is called a ‘<strong>region</strong>’ and then combined using a weighted average to produce the score for the overall area assessed, called a ‘<strong>study area</strong>’. The OHI Toolbox App expects each data file to be in a specific format, with data available for every region within the study area, with data organized in ‘long’ format (as few columns as possible), and with a unique region identifier (<em>rgn_id</em>) associated with a single <em>score</em> or <em>value</em>. In order to calculate trend, input data must be available as a time series for at least 5 recent years (and the longer the time series the better, as this can be used in setting temporal reference points).</p> <p>The example below shows information for a study area with 4 regions. There are two different (and separate) data layer files: tourism count (tr_total.csv) and natural products harvested, in metric tonnes (np_harvest_tonnes.csv). Each file has data for four regions (1-4) in different years, and the second has an additional ‘categories’ column for the different types of natural products that were harvested. In this example, the two data layers are appropriate for status calculations with the Toolbox because:</p> <ol style="list-style-type: decimal"> <li>At least five years of data are available,</li> <li>There are no data gaps</li> <li>Data are presented in ‘long’ or ‘narrow’ format (not ‘wide’ format).</li> </ol> <p><strong>Example of data in the appropriate format:</strong></p> <div class="figure"> <img src="fig/formatting_data_example.png" /> </div> </div> <div id="gapfilling" class="section level3"> <h3><span class="header-section-number">4.9.2</span> Gapfilling</h3> <p>It is important that data prepared for the Toolbox App have no missing values or ‘gaps’. Data gaps can occur in two main ways: 1) <strong>temporal gaps</strong>: when several years in a time series in a single region have missing data, and 2) <strong>spatial gaps</strong>: when all years for a region have missing data (and therefore the whole region is ‘missing’ for that data layer).</p> <p>How these gaps are filled will depend on the data and regions themselves, and requires thoughtful, logical decisions to most reasonably fill gaps. Each data layer can be gapfilled using different approaches. Some data layers will require both temporal and spatial gapfilling. The examples below highlight some example of temporal and spatial gapfilling.</p> <p>All decisions of gapfilling should be documented to ensure transparency and reproducibility. The examples below are in Excel, but programming these changes in software like R easily enables transparency and reproducibility.</p> <div id="temporal-gapfilling" class="section level4"> <h4><span class="header-section-number">4.9.2.1</span> Temporal gapfilling</h4> <p>Temporal gaps are when some data are available for a region, but there are missing years. The Toolbox requires data for each year for every region. It is important to make an informed decision about how to temporally gapfilling data.</p> <div class="figure"> <img src="fig/temporal_gaps.png" /> </div> <p>Many times, creating a linear model is the best way to estimate data and fill temporal gaps. If data do not fit a linear framework, other models may be fit to help with gapfilling. Here we give an example assuming linearity.</p> <p>Using a linear model can be done in most programming languages using specific functions, but here we show this step-by-step using functions in Excel for Region 1.</p> <p><strong>Temporal gapfilling example (assumes linearity):</strong></p> <p>There are four steps to temporally gapfill with a linear model, illustrated in the figures with four columns.</p> <p><strong>1. Calculate the slope for each region</strong></p> <p>The first step is to calculate the slope of the line that is fitted through the available data points. This can be done in excel using the <strong>SLOPE(known_y’s,known_x’s)</strong> function as highlighted in the figure below. In this case, the x-axis is <em>years</em> (2005, 2006, etc…), the y-axis is <em>count</em>, and the Excel function automatically plots and fits a line through the known values (177.14 in 2005, 212.99 in 2008, and 228.81 in 2009), and subsequently calculates the slope (12.69).</p> <div class="figure"> <img src="fig/filling_temporal_gaps_slope.png" /> </div> <p><strong>2. Calculate the y-intercept for each region</strong></p> <p>The next step is to calculate the intercept of the line that is fitted through the available data points. This can be done in excel similarly as for the slope calculation, using the the <strong>INTERCEPT(known_y’s,known_x’s)</strong> function that calculates the y-intercept (-25273.89) of the fitted line.</p> <div class="figure"> <img src="fig/filling_temporal_gaps_intercept.png" /> </div> <p><strong>3. Calculate y for all years</strong></p> <p>The slope and y-intercept that were calculated in steps 1 and 2 can then be used along with the year (independent variable) to calculate the unknown ‘y-values’. To do so, simply replace the known three values into the <strong>y = mx + b</strong> equation, to calculate the unknown ‘count’ for a given year (189.39 in 2006, and 202.08 in 2007).</p> <div class="figure"> <img src="fig/filling_temporal_gaps_value.png" /> </div> <p><strong>4. Replace modeled values into original data where gaps had occurred</strong></p> <p>Substitute these modeled values that were previously gaps in the timeseriew. The data layer is now ready for the Toolbox, gapfilled and in the appropriate format.</p> </div> <div id="spatial-gapfilling" class="section level4"> <h4><span class="header-section-number">4.9.2.2</span> Spatial gapfilling</h4> <p>Spatial gaps are when no data are available for a particular region. The Toolbox requires data for each region. It is important to make an informed decision about how to spatially gapfilling data.</p> <div class="figure"> <img src="fig/gapfilling_spatial.png" /> </div> <p>To fill gaps spatially, assumptions must be made that one region is like another, and data from another region will be substituted in place of the missing data. This will depend on the type of data and the properties of the regions requiring gapfilling. For example, if a region is missing data but has similar properties to a different region that does have data, the missing data could be ‘borrowed’ from the region with information. Each data layer can be gapfilled using a different approach when necessary.</p> <p><strong>Characteristics of region regions requiring gapfilling that can help determine which type of spatial gapfilling to use:</strong></p> <ol style="list-style-type: decimal"> <li><p>proximity: can it be assumed that nearby regions have similar properties?</p></li> <li><p>study area: are data reported for the study area, and can those data be used for subcountry regions?</p></li> <li><p>demographic information: can it be assumed a region with a similar population size has similar data?</p></li> </ol> <p><strong>Spatial gapfilling example:</strong></p> <p>For a certain data layer, suppose the second region (rgn_id 2) has no data reported, as illustrated in the figure above. How to spatially gapfill rgn_id 2 requires thinking about the properties and characteristics of the region and the data, tourist count.</p> <p>Here are properties that can be important for decision making:</p> <p>rgn_id 2:</p> <ul> <li>is located between rgn_id 1 and 3</li> <li>is larger than rgn_id 1</li> <li>has similar population size/demographics to rgn_id 3</li> <li>has not been growing as quickly as rgn_id 4</li> </ul> <p>There is no absolute answer of how to best gapfill rgn_id 2. Here are a few reasonable possibilities:</p> <p>Assign rgn_id 2 values from:</p> <ul> <li>rgn_id 1 because it is in close proximity to rgn_id 2</li> <li>rgn_id 3 because it is in close proximity to rgn_id 2 and has similar population size/demographics</li> <li>rgn_id 1 and 3 averaged since they are in close proximity to rgn_id 2</li> </ul> <p>Suppose the decision was made to gapfill rgn_id 2 using the mean of rgn_id 1 and 3 since this would use a combination of both of those regions. Again, other possibilities could be equally correct. But some form of spatial gapfilling is required so a decision must be made. The image below illustrates this in Excel.</p> <div class="figure"> <img src="fig/gapfilling_spatial_example.png" /> </div> <p>The data layer is now ready for the Toolbox, gapfilled and in the appropriate format.</p> </div> </div> <div id="long-formatting" class="section level3"> <h3><span class="header-section-number">4.9.3</span> Long formatting</h3> <p>The Toolbox expects data to be in ‘long’ or ‘narrow’ formatting. Below are examples of correct and incorrect formatting, and tips on how to transform data into the appropriate format.</p> <p><strong>Example of data in an incorrect format:</strong></p> <div class="figure"> <img src="fig/formatting_long_example.png" /> </div> <p>With ‘wide’ format, data layers are more difficult to combine with others and more difficult to read and to analyze.</p> <p><strong>Transforming data into ‘narrow’ format:</strong></p> <p>Data are easily transformed in a programming language such as R.</p> <p>In R, the <code>reshape</code> package has the <code>melt</code> command, which will melt the data from a wide format into a narrow format. It also can <code>cast</code> the data back into a wide format if desired. R documentation:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape2/reshape2.pdf">http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape2/reshape2.pdf</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jeffreybreen/reshaping-data-in-r">http://www.slideshare.net/jeffreybreen/reshaping-data-in-r</a></li> <li><a href="http://tgmstat.wordpress.com/2013/10/31/reshape-and-aggregate-data-with-the-r-package-reshape2/">http://tgmstat.wordpress.com/2013/10/31/reshape-and-aggregate-data-with-the-r-package-reshape2/</a></li> </ul> <p>Example code using the <em>melt</em> command in the <em>reshape2</em> library. Assume the data above is in a variable called <em>data_wide</em>:</p> <div class="figure"> <img src="fig/melt_code.png" /> </div> <p>This will melt everything except any identified columns (‘Region’ and ‘DataLayer’), and put all other column headers into a new column named ‘Year’. Data values will then be found in a new column called ‘value’.</p> <p>The final step is optional: ordering the data will make it more easy to read for humans (R and the Toolbox can read these data without this final step):</p> <p><strong>Example of data in the appropriate format:</strong></p> <div class="figure"> <img src="fig/formatting_long_example_2.png" /> </div> <p>With ‘narrow’ format, each row of data provides complete and unique information, and does so with as few columns as possible. Data layers in this format can be easily combined with other data layers: the range of years available can be different for each data layer, and there are minimal column names.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div id="installing-the-toolbox" class="section level1"> <h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Installing the Toolbox</h1> <div id="overview" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Overview</h2> <p>The <strong>OHI Toolbox</strong> is essentially several folders containing all the files required for an OHI assessment.

GitHub has specific words for each of these steps. You have already successfully <strong>cloned</strong> an online repository to your local machine. After making modifications, you will <strong>commit</strong> these changes with a description before being able to sync back to the online repository. <strong>Synching</strong> involves both <strong>pulling</strong> any updates from the online repository before <strong>pushing</strong> committed changes back to the server.</p> <p>The example below illustrates GitHub’s collaborative workflow with the <code>ohi-israel</code> repo owned by <code>OHI-Science</code>:</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <blockquote> <div class="figure"> <img src="fig/clone_push_pull.png" /> </div> </blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p><strong>All changes within your local repository will be tracked by GitHub regardless of the software you use to make the changes</strong>.

We recommend doing as much data manipulation as possible in a programming language like R, to maximize transparency and reproducibility. When modifying R scripts such as <code>functions.r</code>, you will need to work in R.</p> <p>We recommend syncing with either the GitHub app or with RStudio. Both methods require you to commit your changes, before pulling any updates and pushing your modifications. The GitHub app combines the pulling and pushing into one step, called syncing.

The global data was reported by subregions (<em>saup_id</em>) and in some cases multiple subregions were part of the same, larger EEZ. Since for OHI we wanted results by EEZ (<em>rgn_id</em>), in those cases we needed to combine results from the subregions to get the final score, based on their size relative to the total EEZ size (<em>prop_area</em>).<br /> <em>If catch is reported for the same areas for which OHI is calculated:</em> then all the <em>prop_area</em> are = 1.<br /> <em>If catch is reported for the whole area of the assessment, but you want to calculate a separate OHI score for different sub-regions:</em> for each OHI reporting region (<em>rgn_id</em>) you’ll repeat the same region in the <em>saup_id</em> column, and <em>prop_area</em> will be =1.

Include resilience in the CMSY code:</strong></p> <p>In the CMSY R script, in the PARAMETERS section, replace the following:</p> <blockquote> <div class="figure"> <img src="fig/include_resilience.png" /> </div> </blockquote> <p><strong>2. Make assumptions about fisheries regulations:</strong></p> <p>If you assume that fisheries are depleted and there isn’t very much fisheries regulation, and you are using the CMSY method to assess B/Bmsy, the original model may work well. If, however, the catch of a species declined because fisheries regulations have closed or limited the fishery, or if a fishery was abandoned for economic reasons (e.g., change in consumer prefereces, market price dynamics, etc.), the model may be too pessimistic and understimate B/Bmsy. In that case it may be best to use a version with a uniform prior on final biomass, instead of the constrained prior.<br />The original constrained prior on final biomass is set by this line within the code:</p> <pre><code>finalbio    &lt;- if(ct[nyr]/max(ct) &gt; 0.5) {c(0.3,0.7)} else {c(0.01,0.4)}    </code></pre> <p>The model uses a uniform prior if that line is replaced with:</p> <pre><code>finalbio    &lt;- c(0.01,0.7) </code></pre> <p><strong>3. Use data at a different spatial resolution than the final assessment:</strong></p> <p>See notes above for <code>fis_proparea_saup2rgn</code></p> <p><strong>4. Calculate B, or Bmsy:</strong></p> <p>The CMSY model calculates B/Bmsy as a ratio, it does not estimate the two variables separately.</p> <p><strong>5. Use catch per unit of effort (CPUE):</strong></p> <p>The CMSY model requires total biomass removed by fisheries, and uses catch as a proxy for that. It cannot use CPUE. Other more sophisticated stock assessment models use CPUE and may be employed. We do not provide documentation for the use of these other models.</p> <p><strong>6. Use other life-history characteristics, in addition to resilience:</strong></p> <p>The CMSY model does not use more detailed information. Other more sophisticated stock assessment models use other life-history traits such as fecundity, larval dispersal, r, K, Lmax, etc., and may be employed. We do not provide documentation for the use of these other models.</p> <p><strong>7. Create a ‘taxonkey’ to assign to each species:</strong></p> <p>When replacing the SAUP_FAO data with your own data, assign a key of 600000 to all species. For all catch that is reported at genus or coarser taxonomic level, you will have to choose an appropriate taxonkey. You can create your own key, from 100000 to 500000, based on your own judgment of how many species may be reported under that same denomination, and how different they may be (all that matters for the toolbox code is whether the number starts with a 1,2,3,4,5 or 6 with 1 being the coarsest, such as ‘miscellaneous marine animals’, or ‘crustaceans nei’).</p> </div> <div id="resources" class="section level4"> <h4><span class="header-section-number">6.6.1.3</span> Resources</h4> <p>Martell, S &amp; Froese, R (2013) “A simple method for estimating MSY from catch and resilience”. <em>Fish and Fisheries</em>, DOI: 10.1111/j.1467-2979.2012.00485.x. <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CCkQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.iotc.org%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fdocuments%2F2013%2F06%2FIOTC-2013-WPNT03-INF01%2520-%2520Martell%2520%2526%2520Froese%25202012.pdf&amp;ei=PXryU6TtGY3goATglYHoDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNE-S0T1B7B_l7rUYaNNLxsUDguDaQ&amp;bvm=bv.73231344,d.cGU">Downloadable here</a></p> <p>Rosenberg, A.A., Fogarty, M.J., Cooper, A.B., Dickey-Collas, M., Fulton, E.A., Gutiérrez, N.L., Hyde, K.J.W., Kleisner, K.M., Kristiansen, T., Longo, C., Minte-Vera, C., Minto, C., Mosqueira, I., Chato Osio, G., Ovando, D., Selig, E.R., Thorson, J.T. &amp; Ye, Y.

A few questions are related to general concepts in the Ocean Health Index, but mostly those topics are covered at <a href="http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/About/FAQ/">http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/About/FAQ/</a>. Here, the FAQ are primarily technical questions regarding regional assessments and using the OHI Toolbox. This document will be updated continually as we have more questions. Questions are arranged by theme, and have the format Q: (question) and A: (answer).</p> <div id="overall" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Overall</h2> </div> <div id="conceptual" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Conceptual</h2> <p><strong>Q: Are regional assessment scores comparable with global assessment scores?</strong></p> <p>A: Regional Index scores cannot be directly compared to global Index scores, or to other regional Index scores calculated through separate efforts. This is because data and indicators (both what they measure and their quality), reference points (set using local knowledge and priorities), and specific goal models are often different for the areas being compared.</p> <p>However, because scores for each goal are scaled to a reference point, qualitative comparisons can be made. For example, a score of 71 in the US West Coast compared to 66 in Brazil says that the US West coast is closer to fully meeting its sustainable goals (i.e., meeting regional reference points). Furthermore, use of the same Ocean Health Index framework across regional assessments permits fruitful discussion and general comparisons even if data inputs differ. Ocean Health Index assessments at any scale always work within a standardized definition of ocean health, using information to capture the philosophy of the ten goals that have been identified (and undergone scientific peer-review) prior to compiling relevant data. Use of the ten-goal framework is important both to ensure that all aspects of ocean health are captured and to allow better comparison across regional assessments than would be possible if the different regions used different methods.</p> <p><strong>Q: Where is climate change measured in the Index?</strong></p> <p>A: Four different aspects of climate change – increases in sea surface temperature (SST), sea level rise (SLR), ultraviolet radiation (UV), and ocean acidification (OA) – are included as pressures to many goals in the Index, including Natural Products, Carbon Storage, Coastal Protection, Sense of Place, Livelihoods &amp; Economies and Biodiversity. Mitigation of climate change through carbon storage is one of the ten goals.</p> <p><strong>Q: Why are food provision and artisanal fishing opportunities goals separated?</strong></p> <p>A: These goals measure different aspects of how people relate to fishing. The catch of fish made by artisanal (=small-scale, subsistence type) fisheries is captured in the food provision goal. Jobs, wages and income from both the food provision and artisanal fishing goals are captured in the livelihoods &amp; economies goal. The purpose of the artisanal fishing opportunity goal is to evaluate the opportunity for people to pursue this fishing in relation to their need to do so.</p> </div> <div id="timing-and-resources" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> Timing and Resources</h2> <p><strong>Q: How much does it cost to produce a regional assessment?</strong></p> <p>A: Regional assessments can be completed at(varying costs depending on the local context.(Funds are needed for a management and scientific team, workshops and meetings (including travel), communications, policy engagement, and operating costs. Therefore, securing funding is an important component to satisfactorily complete the assessment. We encourage the development of a local proposal or strategic action plan that details a timeline of activities and the resources needed to accomplish them.</p> <p><strong>Q: How many people are required in a team?</strong></p> <p>A: rather than a specific number of individuals, what is required are specific skillsets. For example, if the scientific analysts were capable of effectively conducting the R analysis, then a dedicated R analyst would not be required. In current assessments, teams range between 2 and 8 people.</p> <p><strong>Q: How long does it take to calculate OHI at a regional scale?</strong></p> <p>A: This depends on many things: budget and number of people involved, the scale of the study area and whether new regions will need to be created, how easily data can be acquired, how much local data can be incorporated, how many goal models need to be changed. Additionally, decisions about setting reference points require input from experts.</p> <p><strong>Q: How much time will modifications by an R analyst take?</strong></p> <p>A: This will depend on if you are changing any models, and potentially data layers–but a lot of changing data layers just requires registering them properly in layers.csv (and maybe pressures_matrix.csv and resilience_matrix.csv if they are pressures or resilience files) and having the functions.r file call those layers. That is more ‘bookkeeping’ than actual R programming.</p> <p><strong>Q: How much time will modifications by a GIS analyst take?</strong></p> <p>A: this will depend on how many layers you are processing: you are clipping spatial data? That will take some time because there are quite a few files, but maybe not too long since it is pretty small scale and once there is a clipping mask created I think you apply it to other files.</p> <p><strong>Q: Which goals require a GIS analyst?</strong></p> <p>A: All goals using spatial data could potentially require a GIS analyst. These goals are commonly: habitat-based goals and sub-goals: (Coastal Protection, Carbon Storage, Habitats—a sub-goal of Biodiversity), Food Provision, Sense of Place, Species—a sub-goal of Biodiversity, Clean Waters</p> </div> <div id="structure" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">7.4</span> Structure</h2> <p><strong>Q: Can we remove or add goals to the OHI?</strong></p> <p>A: A lot of deliberation went into defining the ten goals, and they seem to do a pretty good job of covering many if not most ocean uses, so additional goals may not be necessary. But it could be that they eclipse or replace an existing goal.</p> </div> <div id="reference-points" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">7.5</span> Reference points</h2> <p><strong>Q: Can planning targets can be used as the reference points?</strong></p> <p>A: Yes, planning targets can be used as reference points. This won’t be appropriate for every goal, but there are cases where this seemed best (example: iconic species sub-goal in the global assessment, mariculture sub-goal in the US West Coast assessment).</p> <p><strong>Q: What is sector evenness?</strong></p> <p>A: Sector evenness (also called a diversity index) is an economic concept that is included in OHI to enable comparison across many different sectors included in the Livelihoods &amp; Economies goal. This goal evaluates jobs, wages and revenues for nine marine employment sectors. The distribution of employment across these nine sectors is an effective indicator of resilience. If total employment within a community is primarily based in one or two sectors, the overall economic system will be excessively vulnerable to downturns in those sectors. Conversely, if employment is spread relatively evenly throughout all nine sectors, the overall system will be more robust and resistant to such disturbances. Overall revenue within the community will remain more stable during such downturns, and workers displaced by a downturn in their sector may be able to find employment in another sector without leaving the community.</p> </div> <div id="appropriate-data-layers" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">7.6</span> Appropriate data layers</h2> <p><strong>Q: Shipping and port activity are hardly affected by the health of the ecosystem. Why are these included in the Index?</strong></p> <p>A: Shipping and port activity are included as pressures only</p> <p><strong>Q: Can oil spills be included in OHI?</strong></p> <p>A: Yes, oil spills could be included as a pressure and in the Clean Waters goal.</p> <p><strong>Q: Is seasonal (non-permanent) sea ice included in OHI habitats?</strong></p> <p>A: No, sea ice only includes permanent sea ice.</p> <p><strong>Q: Can seaweeds be included in the Carbon Storage goal?</strong></p> <p>A: Because they store carbon for less than 100 years, seaweeds and corals are not included in the carbon storage goal. While the pelagic oceanic carbon sink (phytoplankton) plays a large role in the sequestration of anthropogenic carbon, the pelagic ocean mechanisms are not amenable to local or regional management intervention. Phytoplankton and contribute to carbon fixation when they die and sink to the sea bottom at sufficient depth, because it is effectively out of circulation. However, if those phytoplankton are eaten, the carbon is cycled back into the system and not sequestered. Something that could potentially be included in the carbon storage goal is mollusc shells, if they are added to a landfill and not recycled in the sea. So if information on mariculture production and waste disposal are available, this could be an interesting addition to carbon storage at a regional scale.</p> <p><strong>Q: Is coastal engineering included in Coastal Protection? What if it reduces erosion?</strong></p> <p>A: We did not include an assessment of the protection afforded by man-made structures, such as jetties and seawalls, because these structures cannot be preserved without maintenance, may have other negative side effects (e.g. alter sedimentation rates causing erosion in new locations), thus they do not constitute long-term sustainable services. Coastal engineering (jetties, harbours, marina and breakwater) is not natural, and is mostly seen as a pressure. It will also be evident in the status of due to decreased natural habitat. It gets tricky when structures are built to help reduce coastal erosion–they are still manmade and therefore not a natural benefit that the ocean provides. But if available data allow, it might be possible to include tradeoff effects: maybe in areas where natural habitats are degraded and man-made structures have been built to reduce erosion, we could reduce the pressure that would otherwise be applied.</p> <p><strong>Q: How is seawater used for cooling on-shore power plants incorporated into OHI?</strong></p> <p>A: The use of cooling water for on-shore power plants would be a pressure on the ocean, since it causes entrapment of fishes, larvae, etc, and usually is circulated back into the ocean at higher temperatures (and maybe other chemicals, minerals, etc). Since the energy is coming from land-based activities, there isn’t a service that the ocean is providing that ‘benefits’ people, it is only a pressure from the OHI perspective.</p> <p><strong>Q: How is freshwater production through desalination incorporated into OHI?</strong></p> <p>A: Desal would be incorporated into OHI in several places. The benefit is that there is freshwater produced, which could be incorporated into the Natural Products goal (or potentially into its own goal). Data required would be the volume of freshwater created based on the volume of seawater involved and spatial extent. Setting the reference point would not be based on how much can be produced, but some other targets perhaps set by government (percentage of the population served). Similar to the mariculture sub-goal and tourism goals, any negative effects caused by desal that affect other goals (example: species) do not influence the ability to obtain desalination targets now and in the future. Therefore, the sustainability coefficient only measures the ability to sustain that goal, but not the impacts on other goals: instead, they are taken into account as pressures when calculating the other goals. Desal should be included as a pressure similar to cooling on-shore power plants since the discharge brine is dense, doesn’t plume very well and there are chemicals involved.</p> </div> <div id="food-provision" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">7.7</span> Food Provision</h2> <p><strong>Q: Could the culture of marine fish in closed pools on-shore be included in the Mariculture sub-goal?</strong></p> <p>A: This should not be included because onshore aquaculture does not require a marine environment.</p> <p><strong>Q: Can aquaculture farms that receive seawater supply and return seawater back to the sea be included in the food provision goal?</strong></p> <p>A: This would be more appropriately included in the Mariculture sub-goal, and with finer-scale data additional pressures due to the intake pipes and the processed brine back into the marine system could be incorporated as well. Natural Products</p> <p><strong>Q: If natural products are all produced through on-land aquaculture, should this goal be removed?</strong></p> <p>A: In this case you would probably have good reason to exclude the natural product goal due if this was defendable through discussions with experts and any reports/papers on the topic. This would also depend on the origin of these natural products–are they from the region’s waters? Habitat-based goals</p> <p><strong>Q: How is coral health calculated?</strong></p> <p>A: Coral health was estimated by compiling point data from multiple studies of percent live coral cover. In other words, estimates of coral cover within transects of certain sites were repeated in time and we used that rate of change in time as an indication of health of the reefs in the whole region. The difficulty lies in 1) having enough different locations sampled that you can say something about the whole region and 2) finding studies that did repeated measures in time, in the same location, over at least 20 years. In the Global 2013 assessment, there were so few datasets that satisfied this condition that we had to pool observations from different locations.</p> <p><strong>Q: Is it possible to calculate habitat goals when there is only one year of habitat data?</strong></p> <p>A: With only one year of habitat data, it is not possible to calculate the trend (which requires 5 years of data). Instead, it might be best to use the available habitat data to calculate the current status and then to overlay pressures for the last 5 years to calculate trend.</p> </div> <div id="livelihoods-economies" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">7.8</span> Livelihoods &amp; Economies</h2> <p><strong>Q: Benefits gained from Wild-caught fisheries, Mariculture, Tourism &amp; Recreation are included in specific goals. Why are these counted again in Livelihoods &amp; Economies?</strong></p> <p>A: The quantity of fish, mariculature, and participation in T&amp;R are considered separately in goals whereas the monetary component is captured in L&amp;E.</p> <p><strong>Q: Why are revenue data from shipping, boat building, ports and harbors included as revenue? Do these activities rely on a healthy ocean?</strong></p> <p>A: These sectors are included in the Ocean Health Index because the demand for some of those boats (fishing boats, sailboats, yachts) is dependent on a healthy ocean.</p> <p><strong>Q: Why isn’t oil and gas industries included in revenue?</strong></p> <p>A: The Natural Products goal does not include non-living items such as oil, gas, and mining products, because these practices are not considered to be sustainable. They are also done at such large scales that including them would essentially make OHI an index for oil and mining–and they are not truly an ocean product. Because these products are not included in terms of quantity extracted, it did not seem appropriate to include information regarding jobs, wages or revenue.</p> </div> <div id="tourism-recreation" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">7.9</span> Tourism &amp; Recreation</h2> <p><strong>Q: How do I calculate the sustainability term for TR?</strong></p> <p>A: The best way is to use a local indicator or measure of tourism sustainability or competitiveness, otherwise use the TTCI value from the Global 2013 assessment for the study area (applied evenly across all regions.</p> </div> <div id="natural-products" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">7.10</span> Natural Products</h2> <p><strong>Q: Where do Natural Products come from?</strong></p> <p>A: In the global assessments, Natural Products data come from the UN’s Food and Agriculture Administration (www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/software/fishstatj/en). These data are compiled and reported by product for each country, and available by downloading the FishStatJ software.</p> </div> <div id="species" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">7.11</span> Species</h2> <p><strong>Q: Can species and iconic species model scores be penalized if there are local flagship species that have not been evaluated?</strong></p> <p>Global data are based on IUCN assessments. For these evaluations, IUCN chooses a taxon (e.g. sharks) and a group of world experts assess it comprehensively. Locally identified species identified in a regional assessment may not be in the IUCN database because they do not belong to one of the taxa that have been selected for assessment, or because the experts that did the assessment did not know that information existed. In either case, there is no connection between what IUCN reports and what assessments are done locally. Therefore, it might not be fair to penalize a study area for missing species. For biodiversity, it is unrealistic to expect that all species are assessed, so it seems unfair to penalize for unassessed species. In the fisheries goal, there are penalties for species that are exploited but not assessed, because if there are landings data, it means they are somewhat measurable, and so it is reasonable to expect they should be at least monitored.</p> <p>It might be reasonable to penalize unassessed iconic species. It is a smaller list of species that are specifically identified as being of interest, for one reason or other. This would work for species that have some form of assessment - unless that information already exists, it might be unrealistic to try to produce the data layer required to develop a new model.</p> </div> <div id="sense-of-place" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">7.12</span> Sense of Place</h2> <p><strong>Q: Data are only available for marine protected areas, not terrestrial protected areas. Can we still calculate the Lasting Special Places sub-goal?</strong></p> <p>A: Yes, it is possible to calculate only the marine component of this sub-goal: this is not ideal but OHI is flexible to work with the data available.</p> </div> <div id="pressures" class="section level2"> <h2><span class="header-section-number">7.13</span> Pressures</h2> <p><strong>Q: How are single ecological pressures (si in Equation S8) calculated?</strong></p> <p>A: Data included in pressures calculations are accessed in the same manner as any other data layer, and rescaled from 0-1 with an appropriate reference point. For further information, see HowTo_GatherAppropriateData and HowTo_CalculatePressures from ohi-science.org.</p> <p><strong>Q: Does the pressures matrix need to be changed?</strong></p> <p>A: It is likely that the pressures matrix will not need to be changed. The weights assigned in the matrix were set using information from the literature and by experts; the matrix was created by Halpern et al. 2012.</p> <p><strong>Q: How is commercial high and low bycatch calculated?</strong></p> <p>A: Commercial high and low bycatch are categorical values that were set based on fishing gear type. This began as a list of gear types used, producing a range of potential bycatch frequencies (from local reports when possible), which can be rescaled.</p> </div> </div> <div id="toolbox-troubleshooting" class="section level1"> <h1><span class="header-section-number">8</span> Toolbox Troubleshooting</h1> <p>The Toolbox prints messages during its processing to help guide error checking and debugging.
