**Video presentation:  <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/ocean-health-index-analysis-with-shiny/" target="blank">"The Ocean Health Index and Shiny"</a>**

In January three members of our OHI science team (Ben Best, Jamie Afflerbach, and Julie Lowndes) went to <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/shiny-developer-conference/" target="blank">RStudio's Shiny Developer's Conference in San Francisco</a>. The conference was an exciting opportunity to meet with some of our data science heroes at RStudio, learn about the newest features of Shiny and discuss our work at OHI and how Shiny fits into the index.

At the conference we were selected to give a short presentation focused on how we use Shiny for the Ocean Health Index. Shiny is the tool we use to display OHI inputs and scores on interactive maps and is a key tool for communicating results to a wider audience. Our presentation is now online: you can view our five-minute presentation <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/ocean-health-index-analysis-with-shiny/" target="blank">"The Ocean Health Index and Shiny"</a>**. 

We were among an elite group of participants that came from the tech industry (AirBnB, Genentech), government agencies (canadian guy?), academia (UBC, Stanford) and more to learn and share how Shiny is being used across all these disciplines.

So what is Shiny? Shiny is an R package developed by RStudio that enables you to turn analyses into interactive web applications without knowing web-development. This is an incredibly powerful tool for data exploration, data visualization, and communication. We are using what we learned at the Shiny Developer's Conference to upgrade our Shiny interactive map for the Ocean Health Index, stay tuned!
