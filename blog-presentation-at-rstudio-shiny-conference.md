In January three of our OHI science team (Ben Best, Jamie Afflerbach, and Julie Lowndes) went to <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/shiny-developer-conference/" target="blank">RStudio's Shiny Developer's Conference in San Francisco</a>. This was a really exciting opportunity to talk with our heroes at RStudio and learn more from them and other conference participants about how to use Shiny. 

There, we presented about how we use Shiny for the Ocean Health Index: it is how we display OHI inputs and scores on interactive maps. Our presentation is now online: you can view our five-minute presentation "Ocean Health Index and Shiny" <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/ocean-health-index-analysis-with-shiny/">here target="_blank"</a>. 

So what is Shiny? Shiny is an R package developed by RStudio that enables you to turn analyses into interactive web applications without knowing web-development. This is an incredibly powerful tool for data exploration and visualization, and communication. We are using what we learned at the Shiny Developer's Conference to upgrade our Shiny interactive map for the Ocean Health Index, stay tuned!
