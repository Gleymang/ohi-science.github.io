## Tagline: Open science with the Ocean Health Index

## What is the Ocean Health Index?
The Ocean Health Index ('OHI') is a way to measure how healthy oceans are. Understanding the state of our oceans is a first step towards ensuring they can continue providing humans benefits now and in the future.

## What are OHI+ assessments?
OHI+ assessments use the OHI framework and are independently-led by anyone interested. OHI+ assessments are often conducted at smaller spatial scales with the purpose of informing marine policy.

## Where have assessments been done?
Assessments at the global scale have been completed from 2012-2015. Assessments have also been completed or are underway at smaller scales within coastal countries or groups of countries around the world.

## How do I get started?
We provide free instruction and software so you can conduct your own OHI+ assessment. There are four phases to the assessment process: Learn, Plan, Conduct, and Inform.

## Who we are
We are a team from the University of California at Santa Barbara and Conservation International that has been completing annual global assessments and developing a program to support OHI+ assessments.

# TOOLS PAGE

The Ocean Health Index relies on open-source datasets, tools and resources to promote transparency and reproducibility. We use open-source analytical and collaborative tools, particularly [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/). We also develop our own tools, which you can find here.

### Ocean Health Index Toolbox

The OHI Toolbox is used to calculate and visualize OHI assessment scores. The Toolbox has two parts: a personalized repository to organize and store information and write goal model equations specific to the local context, and the R package `ohicore`, which is the engine behind calculating and visualizing scores.

  )

You can explore [`ohicore`](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohicore) and see existing OHI and OHI+ assessment repositories in [Projects](). To have a personal repository created for your assessment, please [contact us]().


### Cumulative Human Impacts

<!---Julie note:
I think we should have this earlier as its own thing. Feel free to edit...--->

Cumulative Human Impacts studies provide high-resolution map layers of combined human stressors on the world's ocean (Halpern et al. 2008, 2015). Many of these are used as pressures in global OHI assessments. Explore the [input data maps](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#data/query=(Halpern Cumulative human impacts)/page/0) and methods by topic:
  - <!---would be cool to list specific methods you've done, like for UV, OA, etc right from here--->
  - <!---also we could provide Mel's general script for OHI+ people to clip their pressures using their own polygons--->



Members of the OHI Science team have led workshops on different data science tools.  All materials including data, code and resources are held on GitHub and made freely available as part of the [eco-data-science](https://github.com/eco-data-science) GitHub organization.

# PROJECTS PAGE

## Introductory 1-2 sentences

Here you will find a list of current and completed Ocean Health Index assessments. OHI+ assessments are led by independent groups, who receive technical guidance and support from the OHI team but are fully responsible for all decisions made and scores produced throughout the assessment process. Note that the map below indicates where assessments are taking place although the spatial boundaries may change.

# OHI+ PAGE

## Phases of an OHI+ assessment
OHI+ assessments have four iterative and repeated phases: 1) Learn about the Ocean Health Index and whether it is the right tool for the context; 2) Plan the assessment by building a team and developing a timeline; 3) Conduct the assessment by tailoring the OHI framework and calculating scores using the OHI Toolbox; 4) Inform policy and future assessments by sharing both scores and what was learned during the process. Assessments are most useful when they are repeated through time to understand changes in ocean health and integrated into continuous decision-making processes for adaptive management.

## Learn about the OHI
The Ocean Health Index is a comprehensive assessment tool that evaluates how a suite of goals is delivered to humans. It can be tailored to different contexts with effort to identify and capture what is important in these places. Learn whether the OHI is the right assessment tool for your area.


## Plan an OHI+ assessment
Plan an OHI+ assessment by understanding what is required, which includes identifying the need and spatial area of the assessment, establishing objectives and a timeline of activities, determining resources needed (human and financial), and aligning the assessment process with existing efforts and initiatives identifying objectives. Further, it is important to identify and include collaborators, including key stakeholders or decision-makers in the assessment process.

## Conduct an OHI+ assessment
Conducting an assessment requires tailoring the OHI framework to the local context and using the Toolbox software to calculate scores based on this framework. This requires conceptually identifying important characteristics and priorities in the area, and gathering existing information and developing models to represent the framework. An emphasis is on transparency and reproducible science.

## Inform using OHI+ assessment results
The scores produced from the assessment process, as well as what was learned through the process itself, should be shared. The final scores and methods are important to communicate transparently, but also the successes and challenges of the process (including information and knowledge gaps). These can help to prioritize policy decisions and can also make repeated assessment processes more efficent; both have the ultimate aim of improving ocean health.


# ABOUT PAGE

## What is the Ocean Health Index?

Determining ocean health requires an approach that integrates social, economic, and environmental information. The Ocean Health Index (OHI) is an assessment framework that does this by measuring progress towards a suite of key societal ‘goals’ representing the benefits and services people expect healthy oceans to provide. By analyzing these goals together and scoring them from 0-100, OHI assessments result in a comprehensive picture of the state of the ecosystem and can be communicated to a wide range of audiences.  

Originally developed by an interdisciplinary team of scientists let by Halpern *et al*. and published in the journal *Nature* in 2012, the OHI framework is standardized yet customizable to different contexts and spatial scales. This is possible because the core framework of how goals are scored does not change while the goal models themselves are developed with local information and local decisions specific to the context.

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1XAx6M3Qh5EWEG8CIXykFr7dskVTttBdLOBPguIVZ-pk/pub?w=624&h=480)

Assessments using the OHI framework are facilitated by the OHI Toolbox, a suite of collaborative, open-source tools and instruction that provides structure for data organization and storage, data processing and goal modeling. The Toolbox enables assessments to be transparent, reproducible through access to detailed methods and computational code, repeatable with the ability to modify methods and computational code, and communicable with distillation and visualization to a wide audience.

For more information, please see our sister website at [www.OceanHealthIndex.org](www.OceanHealthIndex.org).


## What is OHI+?

OHI+ are independently-led OHI assessments that are conducted by any group external to the OHI team. Groups have full responsibility of all aspects of the assessments, including all decisions and information involved, and the resulting scores. The OHI team provides the Toolbox software and guidance and can also provide feedback throughout the process.

OHI+ assessments are often conducted at smaller, subnational spatial scales. This allows availability and use of higher quality information and better knowledge of system processes, which allow for models to be developed that better capture the philosophy of the goals in the local context. At the same time, targets (reference points) can be set with more refined knowledge of preferences or priorities of local people or governments at spatial scales where management decisions are made.

OHI+ assessments can be used as a marine planning tool. Resulting scores can help identify policy priorities and management cost-effectiveness, and can be used to simulate management scenarios. It is also possible to use the OHI framework as a marine planning tool even before final assessment scores have been calculated, since conducting an OHI+ assessment requires an inventory of information and knowledge that spans disciplines, space and time, and can be a useful process for understanding the current policy, information and knowledge landscape.

## Who we are

Our current team is based at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) at the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB), and at Conservation International (but there have been many other important [contributors](http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/about/contributors) throughout the years). We are excited to be a part of the open science community and helping make our oceans healthier.

# GOAL DESCRIPTIONS AND APPROACHES

Global OHI assessments categorized and scored ten goals and eight sub-goals representing ocean-derived benefits to people. Most of the goals and sub-goals scored in global assessments will be relevant for OHI+ assessments, although it is important to critically evaluate this in each context. Once it is clear which goals should be assessed, it is important to develop a blueprint of how they would ideally be represented with models based on the knowledge the local system. These models will ultimately be developed with the information available and will likely differ from the ideal, but it is important to make the blueprint to highlight the intent of the goals and help identify the gaps in knowledge and information.

To help inform this process, below is information for each goal and sub-goal included in the global assessments. Along with the philosophy and how 'ideally' they might be modeled are descriptions of the approaches from completed assessments.
