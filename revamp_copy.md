## Tagline: Reproducible science with the Ocean Health Index
*do we like this tagline?*

## What is the Ocean Health Index? 
The Ocean Health Index ('OHI') is a way to measure how healthy oceans are. Understanding the state of our oceans is a first step towards ensuring they can continue providing humans benefits now and in the future.

## What are OHI+ assessments?
OHI+ assessments use the OHI framework and are independently-led by anyone interested. OHI+ assessments are often conducted at smaller spatial scales with the purpose of informing marine policy.

## Where have assessments been done?
Assessments at the global scale have been completed from 2012-2015. Assessments have also been completed or are underway at smaller scales within coastal countries or groups of countries around the world. 

## How do I get started?
We provide free instruction and software so you can conduct your own OHI+ assessment. There are four phases to the assessment process: Learn, Plan, Conduct, and Inform.

## Who we are
We are a team from the University of California at Santa Barbara and Conservation International that has been completing annual global assessments and developing a program to support OHI+ assessments.
