				<h3>Phases of an OHI+ Assessment</h3>
				<p>
					OHI+ assessments have four iterative and repeated phases: 1) Learn about the Ocean Health Index and whether it is the right tool for the context; 2) Plan the assessment by building a team and developing a timeline; 3) Conduct the assessment by tailoring the OHI framework and calculating scores using the OHI Toolbox; 4) Inform policy and future assessments by sharing both scores and what was learned during the process. Assessments are most useful when they are repeated through time to understand changes in ocean health and integrated into continuous decision-making processes for adaptive management.

		<h5>Phase 1</h5>
		<h2>Learn about the OHI</h2>
		<p>
			The Ocean Health Index is a comprehensive assessment tool that evaluates how a suite of goals is delivered to humans. It can be tailored to different contexts with effort to identify and capture what is important in these places. Learn whether the OHI is the right assessment tool for your area.

		<h5>Phase 2</h5>
		<h2> Plan an OHI+ assessment</h2>
		<p>
		Plan an OHI+ assessment by understanding what is required, which includes identifying the need and spatial area of the assessment, establishing objectives and a timeline of activities, determining resources needed (human and financial), and aligning the assessment process with existing efforts and initiatives identifying objectives. Further, it is important to identify and include collaborators, including key stakeholders or decision-makers in the assessment process.

		<h5> Phase 3</h5>
		<h2>Conduct an OHI+ assessment</h2>
		<p>
			Conducting an assessment requires tailoring the OHI framework to the local context and using the Toolbox software to calculate scores based on this framework. This requires conceptually identifying important characteristics and priorities in the area, and gathering existing information and developing models to represent the framework. An emphasis is on transparency and reproducible science.

		<h5> Phase 4</h5>
		<h2>Inform using OHI+ assessment results</h2>
		<p>
			The scores produced from the assessment process, as well as what was learned through the process itself, should be shared. The final scores and methods are important to communicate transparently, but also the successes and challenges of the process (including information and knowledge gaps). These can help to prioritize policy decisions and can also make repeated assessment processes more efficent; both have the ultimate aim of improving ocean health.
