	<h1>Goals</h1>
	
<p>Global OHI assessments categorized and scored ten goals and eight sub-goals representing ocean-derived benefits to people. Most of the goals and sub-goals scored in global assessments will be relevant for OHI+ assessments, although it is important to critically evaluate this in each context. Once it is clear which goals should be assessed, it is important to develop a blueprint of how they would ideally be represented with models based on the knowledge the local system. These models will ultimately be developed with the information available and will likely differ from the ideal, but it is important to make the blueprint to highlight the intent of the goals and help identify the gaps in knowledge and information.</p>

<p>To help inform this process, below is information for each goal and sub-goal included in the global assessments. Along with the philosophy and how ‘ideally’ they might be modeled are descriptions of the approaches from completed assessments.</p>

<hgroup class="NP goals-section-header">
	<img src="/new-site/assets/themes/OHI/img/goals/NP.png" />
	<h3>Natural Products</h3>
</hgroup>

<h4 id="natural-products">Natural Products</h4>

<p>In many countries the harvest of non-food
natural products is important for local economies and can also be traded
internationally. The sustainable harvest of these products is therefore an
important component of a healthy ocean. <strong>This goal assesses the ability of
countries to maximize the sustainable harvest of living marine resources, such
as corals, shells, seaweeds, and fish for the aquarium trade.</strong></p>

<p>It does not include bioprospecting which focuses on potential (and largely unknowable and
potentially infinite) value rather than current realized value, or non-living
products such as oil and gas or mining products which by definition are not
sustainable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Similar to Food Provisions, this goal is trying to capture the value of goods sustainably harvested by the ocean. While Food Provision focuses
on goods for human consumption, Natural Products assesses non-food goods. As these two goals often share similar data sources, it may be time-saving
for the goal keepers of these two goals to work together and gather data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Ideal Approach</em></strong></p>

<p>Ideally, <em>quantity, value, and a sustainability rating of the harvest method</em>
would be available for every marine and coastally-derived natural product within
the regions of a study area. This could include a wide range of non-food products
depending on what is harvested in the study area, including corals, shells,
seaweeds, aquarium fish, and mangrove wood. The ideal reference point would be derived from a
functional relationship of the sustainability of the harvest for each product
relative to the amount of product available in the ecosystem, informed by
scientific studies. Without such information, assumptions and expert judgment
will need to be made to set the reference point.</p>

<p><strong><em>Practical Guidance</em></strong></p>

<p>Whether you use the approach from the global assessment or are developing your
own new model entirely, there are a few tasks that will remain the same because
are key to the philosophy of this goal.</p>

<p>The first is to identify <strong>identify which products are in your study area.</strong> For
example, does your study area have corals, ornamental fishes, sponges? Does your
area yield medicines from the sea, or other products that are not used for
nutrition under <em>Food Provision</em>? Does your area harvest drinking water from
the ocean through desalination plants? Is there a kelp or seaweed industry in
your area? If there are multiple uses of the product, you must also consider
what proportion of the product is used for food, and what proportion is used for
other purposes. As another example, oil from marine mammals was considered but
excluded from the global models, but if a region has a considerable amount of
mammal oil harvest, they should include it in the calculation, keeping in mind
that the sustainability of this type of harvest is likely to be low and should
be reflected in the score.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the global assessments, Natural Products data come from the <a href="www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/software/fishstatj/en" target="_blank">UN’s Food and Agriculture Administration</a>. These data are compiled and reported by product for each country, and available by downloading the FishStatJ software.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If natural products are all produced through on-land aquaculture, you would probably have good reason to exclude the natural product goal. This would also depend on the origin of these natural products–are they from the region’s waters? You should consult with experts and any reports/papers on the topic. In addition, this goal does NOT include non-living items such as oil, gas, and mining products, because these practices are not considered to be sustainable. They are also done at such large scales that including them would essentially make OHI an index for oil and mining–and they are not truly an ocean product.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second task is to think about <strong>where these products are harvested and how
much of them are harvested</strong> in these areas through a period of time. You should
find spatial representation of these products, which can be done by knowing
where they are derived from. Do they come from certain habitats (in the case of
coral) or animals (in the case of fish oil)? This information will help
calculate the sustainability of the harvest of the natural product.  Harvest
amounts and the spatial data are used to calculate <em>exposure</em> further on, and
can also be used to set the <em>relative weighting</em> between the products. These
spatial data may have already been used in other goals, or they may lead you to
find useful data that can be used in other parts of the assessment.</p>

<p>The second task is to think about <strong>where these products are harvested and how
much of them are harvested</strong> in these areas through a period of time. You will
have to assign geographic representation of these products, which can be done by
knowing where they are derived from, ideally, or by assigning relative
weightings. Do they come from certain habitats (in the case of coral) or animals
(in the case of fish oil)? This information will help calculate the
sustainability of the harvest of each natural product.  Harvest amounts and the
spatial data are used to calculate <em>exposure</em> further on, and can also be used
to set the <em>relative weighting</em> between the products. These spatial data may
have already been used in other goals, or they may lead you to find useful data
that can be used in other parts of the assessment.</p>

<p>The third component is to try to find the <strong>sustainability</strong> coefficients of the
identified products. It is possible to measure sustainability in a number of
different ways. Quantitative information can be used, or expert judgment,
perhaps based on information or rough estimates of how sustainable the harvest
method is, which is what was done in Global 2012. We based the sustainability
component on the historical maximum harvest recorded, the maximum harvesting
density recorded, and risk status assessments by the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).  In the absence of
these, we borrowed general principles from fisheries models to provide rough
estimates. If these are given values you could simplify the model, or they could
be derived from two factors, <em>exposure and risk</em>. The <em>exposure</em> will come
from the spatio-temporal harvest amount data already prepared, and the <em>risk</em>
will come from the scientific literature or a developed indicator. For both of
those cases, the values can be calculated in separate equations as part of your
data preparation process.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Global assessments borrow principles from fisheries science to make estimates
of product sustainability. In the Global 2013 assessment the sustainability
component was derived from the historical maximum harvest recorded, the maximum
harvesting density recorded, and risk status assessments by the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One very important thing to consider at this point is your <strong>reference point for
the relative harvest amount</strong>. The relative harvest of your data is multiplied
by the sustainability coefficient in the last step. Setting the reference point
is a decision your team must make based on the available data and an inferred
functional relationship between the harvest of the product and the amount in the
system. Understanding the patterns in harvest can help inform how to set the
reference point. For example, knowing whether harvesting effort was constant or
whether product yields changed due to the market demand and not the
availability. This information could help inform whether it is more appropriate
to set the reference point as the peak yield of the time-series, or some
percentage above or below, or some other approach that is both ambitious and
realistic (<em>SMART</em> principles). The decision you make for the reference point
should be based on the trend of the data; for instance, if your harvests have
only increased over time, which may be indicative of an emerging economy, you
will have to account for that.</p>

	<h3>Food Provision</h3>
</hgroup>

<h3 id="food-provision">Food Provision</h3>

<p>One of the most fundamental services the ocean provides people is the provision
of seafood, whether it is helping meet the basic nutritional needs of over half
of the world’s population to high-end sushi. This goal, then, <strong>measures the
amount of seafood sustainably harvested in a given EEZ or region through any
means for use primarily in human consumption or export</strong> and thus includes
wild-caught commercial fisheries, mariculture, artisanal-scale and recreational
fisheries.</p>

<p>The Food Provision goals aim to maximize the amount of sustainably
produced seafood from wild or ocean-cultured stocks; any unsustainable
extractive practices is penalized, and so is over- or under- harvesting.</p>

<p>Because we do not track where the fish go after being caught or produced, this
goal does not aim to measure food security for the population of a given
country, but instead measures the food provided from its waters.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would be ideal to include catch and effort information for commercially,
recreationally, and artisanally fished species in your area, although most
completed assessments have only been able to include catch information from
commercial fisheries due to data availability limitations. When data become
available for artisanal and/or recreational catch, they could be included as
part of the fisheries sub-goal or as a separate sub-goal depending on the
context.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sub-goals of Food Provision (Fisheries and Mariculture)
measure the amount of goods sustainably harvested from the sea for human
consumption, while the Natural Products goal measures the amounts of <em>non-food</em>
goods for trade (eg. coral, fish for aquarium, etc) in your study area. Data for
both goals are often recorded in the same sources. It may be time-saving for the
goal keepers for these two goals to join efforts to gather data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>General Approach</em></strong></p>

<p>Ideally, you would have information about the quantity of species caught or
harvested (tonnes), the effort involved (particularly important for the
Fisheries sub-goal), the practices used (fishing gear, mariculture inputs,
extraction methods), and the spatial extent where the practices occur (fishing
locations, mariculture farms). Regarding the species caught or harvested in your
area, in Global Assessments, information by species for fisheries and
mariculture are processed separately before being combined to calculate status
scores.</p>

<p>Goal models should also incorporate a <em>indicator of the sustainability of each
practice</em>. In the case of <em>Fisheries</em> sub-goal,  Maximum Sustainable Yield
(MSY) is used as a benchmark, calculated from available harvest (and efforts)
information.</p>

<p>For <em>Mariculture</em>, Mariculture Sustainability Index (MSI) is used in the model.
In the global assessment, MSI is calculated based on three sub-indices that
directly measured long-term renewability of a given mariculture practice: the
wastewater treatment index, the origin of feed index (i.e. fishmeal or other)
and the origin of seed (i.e. hatchery or wild caught).</p>

<p>The <em>overall Food Provision</em> model should not change; it is a combination of
fisheries and mariculture scores, with the contribution of each type of practice
to the overall score is weighted by its relative contribution to the total
seafood yield. This assumes that one tonne of seafood by any method is the same
as any other tonne of seafood. It would be possible to work with different
assumptions and apportion weighting differently.</p>

<p><strong>Pressures and Resilience</strong> measures must be considered as well. What pressures
<em>act on the harvesting of these species?</em> If information allows, pressures and
resilience measures can act on different species, group of species, or
practices separately, as is done with Natural Products. Fishing or harvesting
practices can also act as pressures for other goals, for example destructive
fishing practices can impact habitat-based goals and genetic escapes from
mariculture practices can affect Fisheries and Biodiversity.</p>

<h4 id="fisheries-sub-goal">Fisheries sub-goal</h4>

<p>The Fisheries sub-goal describes the amount of wild-caught
seafood harvested and its sustainability for human consumption. The model
generally compares landings with Maximum Sustainable Yield. A score of 100 means the country or region
 is harvesting seafood to the ecosystem’s production potential in an sustainable
 manner.</p>

<p><strong><em>Practical Guidance</em></strong></p>

<p>Fisheries science is a discipline that in part aims to estimate the amount of
fish that can sustainably be extracted from the sea. For this reason, it is
important to consult with fisheries experts in your study area. Fisheries
experts will be able to advise how to best estimate the maximum amount of catch
that can be sustainably fished, and the information available will determine
what type of modeling to take. There are many different modeling approaches, and
most are based on either catch alone, or catch-per-unit-effort.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Ocean Health Index relies on freely accessible, open-source data that is consistently updated over time. Here are two datasets used in the OHI-Global assessments, which could be also be useful for OHI+ assessments: Fisheries catch over time from the <a href="http://www.seaaroundus.org" target="_blank">Sea Around Us Project</a> and Global fisheries landings over time from <a href="http://www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/en" target="_blank">FAO</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>If only catch data are available</em>, it is highly recommended to follow the
approach in the <em>2013 global assessment</em> (Halpern <em>et al.</em> 2015) rather than the
2012 global assessment (Halpern <em>et al.</em> 2012). All global assessments use
national fisheries catches reported to the Food and Agricutural Organization
(FAO), and the 2013 global assessment used the fisheries modeling method for
data-poor sources developed by <em>Martell &amp; Froese</em> (2013). With this method,
fisheries catch information would be used to calculate the population biomass
(B), and its maximum sustainable yield (B<sub>MSY</sub>). The reference
functional relationship between fisheries catch and effort information would be
used to calculate the present biomass against B<sub>MSY</sub> would be used to
set the reference point. The current status would be calculated using the
present state of every individual species and combining each species together as
the weighted proportion of the total catch.</p>

<p>You can find data for catch-per-unit effort data, and then create a functional
relationship to determine the reference point.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At a global scale, catch, effort, and MSY estimates are not available for
either commercial, artisanal or recreational fishing: only landings data for
commercial fisheries are available through the United Nations Food and
Agriculture program (UN FAO). You will hopefully be able to find more localized
data when conducting your assessment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When collecting data on fish landings, it’s important to consider how you will
divide the data among regions. You should try to assess each fish species by its
entire population across all regions in your study area. The status in the
global assessment model (2013) was calculated based on estimating population
biomass relative to the biomass that can deliver maximum sustainable yield for
each landed stock (B/B<sub>MSY</sub>). This ratio is conventionally used to
inform fisheries management. This approach adopts the population biomass at MSY
(B<sub>MSY</sub>) as a single-species reference point.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are replicating models from the global assessment (2013-2015), do not
split the catch among regions; instead, you want to sum catch across all regions
so you can calculate B/B<sub>MSY</sub> for the whole population.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The principle of the <strong>reference point</strong> should not change. You should be creating
models that penalize scores for harvesting above the maximum sustainable yield,
as defined in your assessment, and scores that penalize for harvesting below the
sustainable yield. The penalties vary for models developed in the global
assessments, where overfished species negatively influence scores more than
under-fished species do.</p>

<p>It is important to also consider <em>buffering around the
reference point</em> (eg. 75% of B<sub>MSY</sub>) because of imperfect knowledge about the data. Part of this
depends on the type of assumptions you want to make about the ecology of fish
species in your area and the impacts upon them from fishing practices. For
instance, when all species are exploited simultaneously, fishing pressure on
each population might be lower due to changes in interactions between species
that occur when a predator population is reduced.</p>

<h5 id="a-note-about-methods-used-in-the-fisheries-goal"><em>A note about methods used in the fisheries goal</em></h5>

<p style="font-size: 90%">

Since Global 2012, several new data-poor approaches have been developed to
assess fisheries that leverage globally-available information (Costello *et
al*., 2012; Martell &amp; Frœse, 2013; Thorson *et al*., 2013).  The estimates of
B/B<sub>MSY</sub> used in Global 2013 were obtained by applying a model
developed by Martell &amp; Frœse, (2013), and referred to as the “catch-MSY” method.
This approach adopts the population biomass at MSY (B<sub>MSY</sub>) as a
single-species reference point.</p>

<p style="font-size: 90%"> The catch-MSY approach improves upon the method used in Global 2012 in that it
leverages a mechanistic understanding of the connection between harvest dynamics
and population dynamics and uses this to infer stock depletion levels as a
function of both historical patterns in catch and of species-specific resilience
traits (Thorson *et al*. 2013). In addition, this model is more informative in
the case of developing fisheries, whereas the Global 2012 approach assumed a
perfect score in cases where a peak with successive decline had yet to be
observed.</p>

<p style="font-size: 90%"> Although it is a data-limited method, the more complex approach better takes into
account species-specific fishery dynamics. The scores for each population were
also combined using a geometric mean, which ensures that smaller, rarer
populations have more weight so that the biodiversity of the catch is taken into
account as well.</p>

<h5 id="calculating-the-fisheries-goal"><em>Calculating the fisheries goal</em></h5>

<p>Calculating the fisheries goal using methods from global assessments (2013-2015
as it is not recommended to use methods from the 2012 global assessment) relies
on catch or catch-per-unit-effort data. The fisheries goal model uses mean catch
and B/B<sub>MSY</sub> for all species. These are two separate steps: the mean
catch is not used to calculate B/B<sub>MSY</sub>. Once you have
B/B<sub>MSY</sub> for all the species, you will combine them together to get a
single fisheries score for each of the regions in your study area. This is where
the mean catch is used: it is a weighting factor so that species with higher
mean catch will contribute more to the final score. You will not need to
calculate this because the Toolbox calculates the weighted mean when you provide
mean catch as an input layer to the Toolbox. The input layer should simply be
the mean catch for each species.</p>

<p>When calculating B/B<sub>MSY</sub> and mean catch, use as much information as
possible: all the years available. Species that have few years of available data
will likely be less accurate and it is important to document this. It is
admissible to have different ranges of years for different species, since too
much information would be lost if all species required the same species range.
However, interpreting why different species have different years of time series
is important. There may be data for 30 years of history for some species, 10 for
others and 5 or 6 for others. It is important to know whether there is only 6
years of data because it is a recent fishery that developed in the last 6 years;
in this case 6 years is enough. But if only 6 years of data are available
because they stopped collecting the data in recent years, you might get a
completely misleading assessment. And of course if you know there was no catch
at all in recent years, it is important to include those recent years as 0’s.
0’s must also be included when calculating B/B<sub>MSY</sub> or the results will
be nonsensical.</p>

<p>How B/B<sub>MSY</sub> is calculated for global assessments is a bit
unsatisfactory and is in the process of being better developed. This is because
the global model is very imprecise, which also affects how to interpret
B/B<sub>MSY</sub> results. <strong>It is important to consult with a fisheries
scientist in your study area, as they will have expertise with the information
and knowledge available in the local context.</strong> If possible, we suggest
calculating the scores using a more precise model as well, so fisheries experts
can assess whether results look reasonable. This is important so that the scores
produced have credibility.</p>

<h4 id="mariculture-sub-goal">Mariculture sub-goal</h4>

<p>Mariculture measures the ability to reach the highest levels of seafood
gained from farm-raised facilities without damaging the ocean’s ability to
provide fish sustainably now and in the future.</p>

<p>Higher scores reflect high food provisioning in a sustainable manner, while not
compromising the water quality in the farmed area and not relying on wild
populations to feed or replenish the cultivated species. A score of 100 means
that a region is sustainably harvesting the greatest amount of farmed seafood
possible based on its own potential (where its maximum potential is estimated in
different ways depending on the assessment).</p>

<p><strong><em>Ideal Approach</em></strong></p>

<p>Ideally, you would find information about the <em>harvest and practices</em>, on the
<em>total area</em> available for mariculture. This could be in terms of s physical area
or area based on siting priorities. You would also find information on the
<em>sustainability</em> of the mariculture practices. This is important because
mariculture competes for space with many other ocean uses, including fishing,
tourism, and other activities.</p>

<p>This approach would not penalize regions that
have less geographic area available for mariculture, though places with fewer
sheltered bays or lower primary production could be at a disadvantage.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Culture of marine fish in closed pools on-shore should not be included because onshore aquaculture does not require a marine environment. However, if the aquaculture farms receive seawater supply and return seawater back to the sea, they should be included in the Mariculture sub-goal. Finer-scale, environmental damages due to the intake pipes and the processed brine back into the marine system could be incorporated as a pressure layer as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fish that are used as feed for other fish (e.g., sprat) would be more appropriate to include in Natural Products. This is because they are not being consumed directly. Fish such as sprat, for example, may be used to feed pigs in addition to other fish, and therefore you would need to know how much (tonnage) is being produced, and where it is going to be able to accurately distinguish these categories to avoid double-counting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Practical Guidance</em></strong></p>

<p>Besides harvest information, either by species or total amount, this goal requires <em>spatial information</em>. You would have to find maps determining where coastal activities are allowed, or find other kind of data that tells you
the usage restrictions for activities in your waters. For example, you can look for
assessments that have been made to identify the coastal and offshore
habitats that are appropriate for each intended type of mariculture species.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The 2012 Global Assessment included the entire area of the coastline assuming
that mariculture could be developed everywhere. This was done because there was
no information about limitations for how much coastal area could be
allotted to mariculture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>reference point</strong> will depend on your context. You should try to account
for the full potential extent of mariculture in your marine areas. This could be
based on a number of variables such as the habitat suitability for each cultured
species, the distance from the coast, information on how local preferences favor the allotment of marine space to mariculture
versus sports, hotels, beaches, tourism, or other uses. This definition of
mariculture potential therefore can be physical or social. Keep in mind that in the Global
approach, a low score can indicate one of two things – that species are being
farmed in an unsustainable manner or that regions are not maximizing the
potential to farm in their marine territorial waters.</p>

<p>It is important to think about the meaning of your reference point. The spatial
reference point in the Global approach assumes that because one country is able
to produce such a high proportion of mariculture to its coastal area, all
regions should be able to as well, given current ecological and technological
conditions. This also assumes that it is socially desirable for all regions to
produce farmed species at this level, which is likely not true for all regions.
The Global approach compared observed production density of all areas to the
highest observed production density after the sustainability coefficient was
applied.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There was a significant change between Global 2012 and Global 2013 to improve
the reference point for this sub-goal. The coastal population was factored in to
the reference point in 2013, where the harvested tonnes per inhabitants within
25 km of the shore was considered. This change was done under the assumption
that production depends on the presence of coastal communities who can provide
the labor force, infrastructures, and economic demand to support the development
and economic viability of mariculture facilities. Thus, two regions with an
equal number of coastal inhabitants harvesting an equal tonnage of cultured
seafood should score the same, even if one is larger than the other, as the
productivity is commensurate to each region’s socio-economic potential to
develop mariculture. This is an example of how improvements in methods occur
over time.</p>
</blockquote>

<!---OM: This is orphan text; was going to remove, but it might be useful or
spark other ideas that should be considered in this section! Global 2012
compared all areas to that with the highest observed production density after
the sustainability coefficient was applied, based on the assumption that all
coastal area in each region could be developed for mariculture at the same
production density as the reference region (i.e., China) and that maximum
potential productivity per unit of area is similar across ecosystems and
regions. This caused regions with extensive proportions of coastline where
mariculture is unsuitable for biological reasons (e.g., the water freezes for
large part of the year) or logistical reasons (e.g., scarcely inhabited), such
as Canada, to be unduly penalized.--->

	<h3>Artisanal Fishing Opportunities</h3>
</hgroup>

<h3 id="artisanal-fishing-opportunities">Artisanal Fishing Opportunities</h3>

<p>Artisanal fishing, often also called small-scale fishing, provides a critical source of food, nutrition, poverty alleviation and livelihood opportunities for many people around the world, in particular in developing nations. As opposed to large, commercial fisheries that usually involves industrial, energy-intensive vessels and long trips, artisanal fisheries refer to households, cooperatives or small firms that use relatively small amounts of capital, energy and small fishing vessels (if any), make relatively short fishing trips, and use fish mainly for local consumption or trade.</p>

<p>In addition, this goal is not about recreational fishing often done in developed countries, which is captured in <em>Food Provision</em> (if it provides food) and Tourism and Recreation goals. Nor is it about the actual amount of fish caught or revenue generated, which are captured by <em>Coastal Livelihood and Economies</em>. Rather, <strong>artisanal fishing opportunities measure whether people who need to fish on a small, local scale have the opportunity to do so.</strong> A score of 100 means the country or region is meeting the needs of artisanal fishermen or communities by implementing institutional supports, providing access to near-shore water, and maintaining the health of targeted species.</p>

<p><strong><em>Ideal Approach</em></strong></p>

<p>Ideally, this goal would include some measure of of how easy or hard it is for fishermen to <em>access</em> ocean resources when they <em>need</em> them and the <em>sustainability</em> of harvest of all nearshore stocks used by artisanal fishers. The need for artisanal fishing is most directly tied to the percent of population below the poverty line. Access, or ability to meet this need, are institutional permits or encouragements for small fisheries. Sustainability of artisanal fisheries refers to the sustainability of fishing gears. Sustainable gears are traditional hook and line, as opposed to unsustainable practices such as dynamite and gill net fishing. Sustainability can also be estimated by assessing the health of targeted species. The type of reference point you use will depend on the data available.</p>

<p><strong><em>Practical Guidance</em></strong></p>

<p>Ideal indicators mentioned above are often scarce, especially percent poverty or the sustainability of fishing gears. You will want to find proxy data for <em>access</em> in whatever way best suits your areas. This could be drawn from physical, economic, regulatory, or stock condition data as an indication of availability. A combination of all of these would be best to more accurately speak to the philosophy, but is is usually limited by data.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the U.S. West Coast Assessment (2014), three metrics were used to define <strong>Artisanal Opportunity</strong> that you can use to study:</p>
</blockquote>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Type of Access</th>

      <td>Resource</td>
      <td>Condition of fish stocks through NOAA Fish Stock Index</td>
      <td>Perfect sustainability score on FSI</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You should include data that are distinct from the catch data used in other areas of <strong>Food Provision</strong>. So once you find catch data and access data, you should think about which goals to use it in. For instance, if you find tonnage of artisanally-caught fish, you should include that elsewhere. In any case, you will likely modify the default Global Assessment model using different and better-resolved data.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, in the Baltic Sea region, <strong>Artisanal Opportunities</strong> is very closely connected to <strong>Tourism and Recreation</strong> since there are a lot of locals and tourists using the shared sea for enjoyment. You will have to decide how to apportion the data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>reference point for this goal</strong> would likely be a metric of having full access to the resource (see examples in the table above). Keep in mind that the access is for people, and therefore a marine protected area may not count towards full access.</p>

	<h3>Carbon Storage</h3>
</hgroup>

<h3 id="carbon-storage">Carbon storage</h3>

<p>Highly productive coastal wetland ecosystems store substantially larger amount of carbon than terrestrial forests and have the highest sequestration rates of any habitats on earth. They are also threatened by under-regulated coastal development but are amenable to restoration and conservation efforts. This goal intends to capture <strong>the ability of the coastal habitats to remove carbon given their carbon updtake rate and health conditions</strong>. A score of 100 means all habitats that contribute to carbon removal are still intact or have been restored and they can function to their full carbon burial potential.</p>

<!-- This definition needs more work... Halpern et.al didn't spell out an definition as did with other goals... -->

<blockquote>
  <p>Habitat-based goals should be considered together during the data gathering process because the same data underly three goals: <strong>Carbon Storage</strong>, <strong>Coastal Protection</strong>, and <strong>Biodiversity</strong>. Goal models to date have depended on the area (square kilometers) of each habitat type in each region, the condition of each habitat, and a weighting to distinguish how different habitats contribute to each goal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Ideal Approach</em></strong></p>

<p>Ideally, you will know which habitats contribute to carbon <em>sequestration and storage</em>, and their <em>capacity</em> to do so. You will also have information on <em>habitat extent</em> and <em>health</em> conditions. The reference point for habitat-based goals will likely be temporal, meaning you will compare the current area of these habitats to some area in the past, and thus historic data are needed. Reference points could also be set by with a proportion increase (or decrease) of known conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Practical Guidance</strong></p>

<p>In terms of habitat types for this goal, it is recommended to search for <em>mangroves, saltmarshes</em>, and <em>seagrasses</em> because these are viewed as carbon-sequestering habitats that are both ecologically threatened and sensitive to policy responses. It is possible that there are other carbon-sequestering habitats present in your study area. But you should remember that we recommend using habitats that can store carbon on the order of 100 years, thereby limiting the types of habitat types you will need. <em>To see how to obtain data on habitat extent and condition, read section on <strong>Biodiversity sub-goal: Habitats</strong></em>.</p>

<p><em>Contribution</em> is relative contribution of each habitat to total carbon storage, measured by the per area, empirical rates of carbon uptake and coverage area. For this you would have to search the literature and find ratios of organic nutrient uptake between habitats, and you would have to make sure these studies represent your study area. For example, were the studies done with a young mangrove forest, or an older one, which might have different growth rates?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Understanding habitat carbon storage rates is an area of ongoing research. The capacity for habitats to store carbon varies, and depends on the morphology of plants in the system. In the global assessment, we assumed equal potential for carbon storage by each habitat, and thus contribution to carbon storage is measured by habitat extents directly.</p>

	<h3>Coastal Protection</h3>
</hgroup>

<h3 id="coastal-protection">Coastal protection</h3>
<p>This goal aims to assess <strong>the amount of protection provided by marine and coastal habitats against flooding and erosion to coastal areas that people value, both inhabited (homes and other structures) and uninhabited (parks, special places, etc.)</strong>. A score of 100 would indicate that these habitats are all still intact or have been restored to their reference conditions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This definition does not include man-made structures such as sea-walls because they are not regarded as sustainable and likely destroyed habitat.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Habitat-based goals should be considered together during the data gathering process because the same data underly three goals: <strong>Carbon Storage</strong>, <strong>Coastal Protection</strong>, and <strong>Biodiversity</strong>. Goal models to date have depended on the area (square kilometers) of each habitat type in each region, the condition of each habitat, and a weighting to distinguish how different habitats contribute to each goal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Ideal Approach</em></strong></p>

<p>Ideally you will have information on the relative potential of habitats to provide coastal protection, and extent and condition of each habitat. The reference point would likely be a historic reference before destruction of coastal habitats.</p>

<p><strong><em>Practical Guidance</em></strong></p>

<p>To see how to obtain data on habitat <em>extent</em> and <em>condition</em>, read the section on <strong>Biodiversity sub-goal: Habitats</strong>.</p>

<p>There can be many <em>habitat types</em> included in Coastal Protection goal. In global assessments, coral, mangroves, saltmarshes, seagrasses, and seaice were included. Habitats were <em>weighted</em> based on their protective ability identified by <a href="www.naturalcapitalproject.org" target="_blank">Natural Capital Project</a>. Depending on the habitats you include, you will need to find additional weights.</p>

<!-- I didn't find information on how to rank on the supplemental paper or natural capital... -->

<p>The goal status model for Coastal Protection developed for global assessments will likely be appropriate for independent assessments. However, it could be possible to incorporate the <em>differences in vulnerability</em> between subcountry regions. Vulnerability can be quantified as the ability to evacuate, economic ability to reconstruct in case of damage. Physical properties may be available in OHI+ assessments, allowing for more a detailed understanding of the protective ability, and likelihood of exposure for each habitat type in different portions of the coastline.</p>

	<h3>Tourism and Recreation</h3>
</hgroup>

<h3 id="tourism-and-recreation">Tourism and Recreation</h3>
<p>Tourism and recreation in coastal areas is a major component of thriving coastal communities and a measure of how much people value ocean systems, i.e. by traveling to coastal and ocean areas. This goal is not about the revenue or livelihoods that are generated by tourism and recreation (that is captured in the livelihoods goal, section 6F above) but instead captures <strong>the value that people have for experiencing and enjoying coastal areas</strong>. A score of 100 means a region utilizes its full recreational potential without harming the ecosystem.</p>

<p><em>Ideal Approach</em></p>

<p>Ideally, you would find information for how the ocean in your area is used and enjoyed by local residents and tourists alike. How many international or domestic vistors? When are they visiting? How long are they staying? What activities are they enjoying? You model should capture the the full range of values and touristic and recreational activities. A measure of sustainability should also be included in the model. The type of reference point used will depend on the data available.</p>

<p><em>Practical Guidance</em></p>

<!--Old text here. I'm not sure if this is useful b/c we are not trying to predict tourism: There are potentially dozens of variables that affect the number of people that engage in tourism and recreation within a region and where they go. These include local and global economies, infrastructure to support the activities, promotion of particular locations, safety and security, and even political stability. -->

<p>First look for information that directly reflect how people enjoy the ocean, such as boat rentals, resort registries, whale watching etc. If you can’t find information on visitors, look for proxy data that are indirectly related. For example, do people have access to boating areas, or to surfing spots? Are tourism-related industries (eg. hotel employment, restaurant) increasing or decreasing?</p>

<p>This goal demonstrates the flexibility of the OHI+ approach and will necessarily draw from different data sources than the Global Assessment. It is encouraged to to think creatively and to look at what other OHI+ assessments have done when developing this goal model. For example, in the Brazil Assessment the density of hotel employees per state was used as a metric to determine how well touristed coastal areas were. This was better than using international travel information, as was used in the Global Assessment, because for a large country like Brazil, internal travel would not have been accounted for.</p>

<p>The best way to represent the sustainability term for this goal is to use a local indicator or a measure of tourism sustainability or competitiveness. Otherwise use the TTCI value from the Global 2013 assessment for the study area (applied evenly across all regions).</p>

<p>The <strong>reference point</strong> used will depend upon the types of data. Does your country have industry growth rate targets? Are there measures on sustainable levels of tourism and recreational activities based on ecological factors? Do you want to increase tourism, or instead ensure it does not decline?</p>

	<h3>Livelihoods and Economies</h3>
</hgroup>

<h3 id="livelihoods-and-economies">Livelihoods and Economies</h3>

<p>The jobs and revenue produced from marine-related industries are clearly of huge value to many people, even for those people who do not directly participate in marine-related industries. People value community identity, tax revenue, and indirect economic and social impacts of a stable coastal economy. This goal tracks <strong>the number and quality of jobs and the amount of revenue produced across as many marine-related industries/sectors as possible</strong> through two sub-goals, Livelihoods and Economies. A score of 100 reflects productive coastal economies that avoid the loss of ocean-dependent livelihoods while maximizing livelihood quality.</p>

<p>In the global study, this goal does not attempt to capture any aspects of <em>job identity</em> (i.e. the reputation, desirability or other social or cultural perspectives associated with different jobs). We make the assumption that all marine-related jobs are equivalent, such that, for example, a fisherman could transition to a job in mariculture or ship-building without affecting the score of this goal. There are also not adequate data to assess workers’ <em>job satisfaction</em> or <em>ecological sustainability</em> of sectors. Future, finer scale applications of the Index could incorporate these key considerations.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oil and gas industries are NOT included in this goal. The Natural Products goal does not include non-living items such as oil, gas, and mining products, because these practices are not considered to be sustainable. They are also done at such large scales that including them would essentially make OHI an index for oil and mining–and they are not truly an ocean product. Because these products are not included in terms of quantity extracted, it did not seem appropriate to include information regarding jobs, wages or revenue.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="sub-goal-livelihoods">Sub-goal: Livelihoods</h4>

<p>This sub-goal describes livelihood quantity and quality for
people living on the coast. Livelihoods includes two equally important sub-components, the number of jobs, which is a proxy for livelihood quantity, and the per capita average annual wages,
which is a proxy for job quality.</p>

<p><strong><em>Ideal Approach</em></strong></p>

<p>Ideally, this sub-goal would speak to the quality and quantity of marine jobs in an area. It would encompass all the marine sectors that supply jobs and wages to coastal communities, incorporating information on the <em>sustainability</em> of different sectors while also telling about the <em>working conditions and job satisfaction</em>. The jobs and revenue produced from marine-related industries directly benefit those who are employed, and also those who gain indirect value from related economic and social impacts of a stable coastal economy, such as community identity and tax revenue. You should capture the indirect as well as direct benefits from jobs, wages and revenue from coastal communities.</p>

<p>In your assessment, there is the opportunity to study the behavior of economic trends in your area. You can examine time-series with greater detail and, for example, establish a different time-periods that reflect economic cycles in your area, or even process the data to eliminate the “noise” from fluctuations and capture more persistent trends.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You will most likely simplify the models from the global assessments. Models in the global assessments adjust for currency differences using the the Consumer Price Index and Purchasing Power Parity, which you likely will not need to do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Practical Guidance</em></strong></p>

<p>The first step of this goal is to <strong>identify the marine-related sectors in your area</strong>. These sectors are important because the <em>Livelihoods</em> goal includes information about <strong>jobs</strong> and <strong>wages</strong> for those sectors. There are jobs that are directly connected to the marine environment, such as shipping, fishing, longshore workers, but also some that are connected indirectly, such as suppliers and supporting industries. For example, the sectors for which data were found in global assessments included tourism, commercial fishing, marine mammal watching, aquarium fishing, water and tidal energy jobs, mariculture, transportation and shipping, ports and harbors, ship and boatbuilding.</p>

<p>After you have identified which jobs are in your area, you will want to find some <strong>measure of their direct and indirect benefits</strong>. Direct benefits of jobs include the number of jobs in each area, and the wages or income for such jobs. You could find such information from you local national statistical office, or economics bureaus, for example. Indirect benefits of these jobs to the local communities are calculated through the use of <em>economic multipliers</em>, with which you can attempt to estimate the revenue generated by jobs more broadly associated with marine sectors. It’s encouraged to use economic multipliers from the literature.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One example to use economic multipliers is to multiply the number of fishermen by a multiplier to estimate larger economic effects, ranging
from gear manufacturing companies to restaurants and movie theaters where the fishermen spend their income.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next you must think about how to use the data to infer <strong>quality and quantity of jobs</strong>. Do you have data through time so that you can see how the number of jobs or the wages per sector have changed over time? If all of the sectors change in the same way, for instance, this might show broader economic trends that you should account for.</p>

<!-- what are good ways to find satisfaction, identity, and sustainability information of different sectors? -->

<blockquote>
  <p>It is highly recommended that you set the <strong>reference point</strong> for <em>jobs</em> as a <em>temporal comparison</em> (eg. the number of jobs five years before), and for for wages as a <em>spatial comparison</em> (eg. highest observed value across reporting units). Comparing the number of jobs across different places, for instance, would require at the
very least adjusting values by the size of the workforce in each location.</p>

<h4 id="sub-goal-economies">Sub-goal: Economies</h4>

<p>Economies captures the economic value associated with marine industries using revenue from marine sectors. It is composed of a single component, revenue.</p>

<p><strong><em>Ideal Approach</em></strong></p>

<p>Ideally, revenue data would be collected for all coastal regions, and traced from sectors both directly and indirectly related to marine industries. When these data are not available it is possible to use revenue data at a larger scale and adapt them to a coastal area based on the population distribution. The reference point in this sub-goal will likely be set with a moving-window temporal approach.</p>

<p><strong><em>Practical Guidance</em></strong></p>

<p>A number of sectors were not included in the Global Assessments because sufficient data did not exist. However, it might be desirable to include sectors such as ecotourism, sailing, kayaking, surfing, and offshore wind energy production, and scientific research, among others. It may be practical to include the same sectors in the <em>Livelihoods</em> and the <em>Economies</em> subgoals.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The quantity of Wild-caught fisheries, Mariculture, and participation of Tourism &amp; Recreation are considered separately in specific goals, whereas the monetary component is captured in L&amp;E.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Revenue data from shipping, boat building, ports and harbors are included as revenue. Those sectors are included because the demand for some of those boats (fishing boats, sailboats, yachts) is dependent on a healthy ocean.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the global assessment, revenue has a moving-target temporal <strong>reference point</strong> by comparing the value in the current year to values in previous years. Global assessments used a five-year moving-window because it is intended to capture short-term changes in the trajectory. But then you must consider if that amount of time would represent economic trends. If there is a not economic downturn, do you want to reward an increasing number of jobs, or reward maintaining the same
number of jobs?</p>

<p>We highly recommend that this remains a temporal comparison so that a specific place is compared to its performance in the past and not to anywhere else.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You may find resilience metrics that can be
used throughout your assessment. There are many economic indices and some might be appropriate for your area. For example, the <em>Global Competitiveness Index</em> was used in global assessments as a resilience for this goal because it means that marine jobs are more likely to be maintained if an area gets a good score on the Competitiveness Index.</p>

	<h3>Sense of Place</h3>
</hgroup>

<h3 id="sense-of-place">Sense of Place</h3>

<p>This goal tries to capture <strong>the aspects of the coastal and marine system that people value as part of their cultural identity</strong>. This definition includes people living near the ocean and those who live far from it but still derive a sense of identity or value from knowing particular places or species exist. We divided this goal into two sub-goals: Iconic Species and Lasting Special Places, and weighted them equally when combining to create a single goal score. A score of 100 means the species and places important for cultural identity are protected and conserved.</p>

<h4 id="sub-goal-iconic-species">Sub-goal: Iconic Species</h4>

<p>Iconic species are those that are relevant to local cultural identity through a species’ relationship to one or more of the following: 1) traditional activities such as fishing, hunting or commerce; 2) local ethnic or religious practices; 3) existence value; and 4) locally-recognized aesthetic value (e.g., touristic attractions/common subjects for art such as whales). Habitat-forming species are not included in this definition of iconic species, nor are species that are harvested solely for economic or utilitarian purposes (even though they may be iconic to a sector or individual). This sub-goal assesses how well those species are conserved.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Data for this goal will likely have considerable overlap with <em>Biodiversity sub-goal: Species</em>. It will be effective for the goal keepers of Biodiversity and Sense of Place to share the data searching efforts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Ideal Approach</em></strong></p>

<p>Ideally, you would have a list of species that are valued as iconic and information on their <em>habitat ranges</em> along with scientific studies that speak to the <em>health</em> of their populations. A reference point is where all iconic species are at a healthy level of existence.</p>

<p><strong><em>Practical Guidance</em></strong></p>

<p>First you need to <em>identify the Iconic Species</em>. In practice, Iconic Species are usually a subset of the broader list of species in an area, and so you should be able to find Iconic Species after having found assessed species data for the <em>Species sub-goal of the Biodiversity goal</em>. (See <em>Biodiversity</em> for more detailed instructions.) Once you have the full list of assessed species, you can determine a subset for <em>Iconic Species</em>. For instance, are there known “indicator species” in your area? Are there species that are culturally held as valuable? Do any species appear on the currency or postage stamps?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since different species are be iconic to different groups, defining which species are iconic can be challenging when it’s a cultural question. You might have to find information from experts on local customs and tradition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The choice of inclusion of iconic species in your list can be subjective. You could also come up with specific inclusion criteria, for instance, that would filter a list of species or filter a subset of the gathered data for <em>Biodiversity</em>. This would be a more rigorous approach because then it could be documented and you could replicate the study in future assessments.</p>

<p>Ultimately, almost any species can be iconic to someone, and so the intent with this goal was to focus on those species widely seen as iconic within a country, and iconic from a cultural or existence value (rather than for a livelihoods or extractive reason). Many lists exist for globally important, threatened, endemic, etc. species, but in all cases it is not clear if or to what extent these species represent culturally iconic species. In the global assessment, species were drawn from the World Wildlife Fund’s global and regional lists for Priority Species (especially important to people for their health, livelihoods, and/or culture) and Flagship Species (‘charismatic’ and/or well-known). These lists are note the only source that included cultural reasons for listing iconic species and you should try to acquire more information on locally relevant species.</p>

<p>After identifying the list of iconic species, you need to find a matrix to reflect the <em>health</em> of their population. In the global study, we used IUCN threat categories and weights. The reference point is to have the risk status of all assessed species as Least Concern. Alternatively, you can use a different kind of assessment approach to see if the populations are healthy, which could be indicated, for instance, by the stability of their populations.</p>

<h4 id="sub-goal-lasting-special-places">Sub-goal: Lasting Special Places</h4>
<p>This sub-goal focuses on those geographic locations that hold particular value for aesthetic, spiritual, cultural, recreational or existence reasons, and assesses how well they are protected.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This sub-goal makes use of protected areas, and some of the same information gathered on projected areas can be used to create <strong>resilience</strong> data layers like Marine Protected Areas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Ideal Approach</em></strong></p>

<p>Ideally, you would be able to survey everyone in your region and produce a list of all the places they consider special, and then assess how well they are protected relative to a desired state. How well they are protected could be the percentage of area protected, and you could also find how well they are protected using other data. This sub-goal could also be based on the extent to which people participate in spiritual or religious activities in an area.</p>

<p><strong><em>Practical Guidance</em></strong></p>

<p>The ideal list of special places don’t exist in practice, and this is a difficult goal to express accurately, since it attempts to capture how people interact culturally with their coastal places. You can define “special” with specific criteria. A good example to look at is the <em>U.S. West Coast assessment (2014)</em> and <em>Brazil Assessment (2014)</em>.</p>

<p>More likely, you would follow the global assessment and use <em>lists of protected areas</em> as catalogues of special places, and the area of designated protected places relative to a <strong>reference point</strong> (eg. of thirty percent coastal area protected) is used as a measure. Coastal area could be based off a 1 square km buffer inland, as in the Global Assessment, or it could be based on what is reasonable to your area. In any case, you would want to consider how far out from shore you should include as well; would it be 3 nautical miles, or as far as your territorial waters up to 12 nautical miles?</p>

<p>Data sources should be specific to your region. International databases, like the <a href="www.protectedplanet.net/">World Database of Protected Areas</a> (www.protectedplanet.net/), offer rich information, but they may not be as up-to-date as the list of national parks in your area, and may not have as much information on the quality of protection. If you have more information on quality, you could think about another approach than the thirty percent reference point target.</p>

<p>Global assessment incorporated both marine and terrestrial protected areas. However, if only data on marine protected areas is available, you can calculate only the marine component of the goal. This is not ideal but OHI is flexible to work with the data available.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you assessment involves multiple categories (e.g., antiquities, MPAs, beaches of special interest), whether you group them together or calculate each category separately depends on reference points. Maybe you want 10% of offshore water to be in MPAs, but only 5% of coastlines to be beaches and 3% Antiquities, for example; in this case, you would calculate them separately and then add them together. But if you want 10% of your country’s coast to have any combination of these things, you would keep them together.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the Global Assessment framework, the <strong>Sense of Place</strong> sub-goals were weighted equally and combined in an average to create a single goal score. The two sub-goals are averaged currently in the framework. But these could be combined with a weighted average.</p>

	<h3>Biodiversity</h3>
</hgroup>

<h3 id="biodiversity">Biodiversity</h3>

<p>People value biodiversity in particular for its existence value. The risk of species extinction generates great emotional and moral concern for many people. As such, this goal assesses <strong>the conservation status of species based on the best available global data through two sub-goals: Species and Habitats</strong>. Species were assessed because they are what one typically thinks of in relation to biodiversity. Because only a small proportion of marine species worldwide have been mapped and assessed, we also assessed Habitats as part of this goal, and considered them a proxy for condition of the broad suite of species that depend on them. We calculate each of these sub- goals separately and treat them equally when calculating the overall goal score. A score of 100 means all species are all species are at very low risk of extinction, and all habitats are conserved.</p>

<h4 id="sub-goal-species">Sub-goal: Species</h4>
<p>This sub-goal assesses the health of all marine species present in a region, including endangered species and species in relatively good conditions. The presence of higher-risk species leads to a higher score.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Data for this goal is also used in Sense of Places sub-goal: Iconic Species. It will be effective for goal keepers of Biodiversity and Sense of Place to work together on data gathering.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Ideal Approach</em></strong></p>

<p>Ideally, you would find data for all species present in your region including information on their <em>habitat ranges</em> along with scientific studies that speak to the <em>health of their populations</em>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Practical Guidance</em></strong></p>

<p>You should start by trying to <em>find spatial information for species</em> that occur in your area and determine <em>whether or not they have been scientifically assessed and given a conservation status</em>. It is best if you only use species for which there are both spatial data and an assessment. In the global assessment, we combined data from recent assessment the International Union for the Conservation of Nature 
[ These data sets provide a geographic snapshot of how total marine biodiversity is faring, even though it is a very small sub-sample of overall species diversity.
(<a href="www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/spatial-data" target="_blank">IUCN</a>) and 
<a href="http://aquamaps.org/" target="_blank">AquaMaps</a>.</p>

<p>IUCN provides global species assessments that indicate the distribution and the conservation status of species, ranging from Least Concern to Critically Endangered to Extinct. These risk categories were turned into these into weights (between 0 and 1) for calculations. AquaMaps offers additional spatial data for species not covered by the IUCN distribution maps. Both evaluations chooses a taxon (e.g. sharks) and a group of world experts assess it comprehensively. Locally identified species identified in a regional assessment may not be in the global database because they do not belong to one of the taxa that have been selected for assessment, or because the experts that did the assessment did not know that information existed. In either case, there is no connection between what IUCN or AquaMaps report and what assessments are done locally. Therefore, it might not be fair to penalize a study area for missing species. For biodiversity, it is unrealistic to expect that all species are assessed, so it seems unfair to penalize for un-assessed species. In the fisheries goal, there are penalties for species that are exploited but not assessed, because if there are landings data, it means they are somewhat measurable, and so it is reasonable to expect they should be at least monitored.</p>

<!-- It might be reasonable to penalize unassessed iconic species. It is a smaller list of species that are specifically identified as being of interest, for one reason or other. This would work for species that have some form of assessment - unless that information already exists, it might be unrealistic to try to produce the data layer required to develop a new model. -->

<p>For regional assessments, local studies of marine species status and local datasets are best here. The spatial information can be a range map with simple presence or absence information, or it can have more detailed data. You can complement the species list search with a scientific literature search to see if anyone has scored the species status in a way that you can use. One thing to keep in mind when using local data sets is that <em>local lists might focus on endangered species and leave species in relatively good conditions un-assessed. This could result in poorer scores.</em></p>

<p>If spatial distribution information for individual species is not available, the goal model could be simplified to be based on threat-status-weighted average in your region.</p>

<p>You should also think about the <strong>reference point</strong> for scores that signal poor Biodiversity status. You can use the same threshold as the Global Assessments which say that <em>places with extinction risk scores greater than seventy-five percent will get scores of zero</em>. This is an estimation based on the literature of mass extinctions (e.g., Barnosky <em>et al</em>., 2011) and could be applied across scales. You don’t need all species extinct for there to be a zero, so you will have to choose how to rescale it, and whether the risk effects are linear or nonlinear.</p>

<p><strong><em>Additional Note: Defining spatial regions and map considerations</em></strong></p>

<p>Once you have gathered the data, the treatment of it will matter for the model and goal score calculation. Do you know how the data were collected? Do you have information on sampling effort? If you don’t know, you may not be sure whether changes in condition are due to monitoring efforts or biodiversity change, and you therefore may want to consider the uncertainty of your model.</p>

<p>In any case, the original logic of the <strong>Species</strong> sub-goal of the <strong>Biodiversity</strong> goal is to represent the species present relative to the proportion of their range within a given region. The goal is to summarize extinction risk for an area across assessed species, and assign it appropriately so that the loss of species scores poorly. You should consider whether the impacts to local species status are linear or non-linear. Will drawing borders affect how your scores are assigned?</p>

<p>When considering how to change the model, you should think about the outcome of the score on your decisions. For instance, will weighting a “Critically Endangered” species higher on the scale result in the inclusion or exclusion of more rare species? Will the way you aggregate spatial data to summarize extinction risk for your area take into account the influence of species with smaller ranges size, or will that information be lost in the averaging process? An inherent disadvantage for conservation may occur when rare species get rarer in the future, and will therefore have a relatively small influence on the score while common species drive the results.</p>

<p>Range size has an impact on score results. For example, if you use the current model, none of the cone snail species listed below will have a big impact on the <strong>Species</strong> sub-goal score because to their small range size that covers one cell of map area. However,  the 0.8 score for <em>Conus roeckeli</em> shows that it is a rare species as assessed by the IUCN. On the other hand, the coral <em>Acropora palmata</em> is also rare and yet covers a large range.</p>

<h4 id="sub-goal-habitats">Sub-goal: Habitats</h4>
<p>The Habitats sub-goal includes all habitats in the study area, and assess their health condition and coverage area.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Habitat is included in the Biodiversity goal to provide a more complete picture of diversity in the system. This is because in global assessments assessed species data were limited and the diversity of habitats can be included with the assumption that healthier habitats mean healthier species. Therefore if you have comprehensive species assessments in your area you may not need to include all habitats as a sub-goal, instead only including living habitats (algae, corals) along with species in the Species sub-goal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Ideal Approach</em></strong></p>

<p>Ideally, information on the area extent (square kilometers) and condition of every habitat type would be available over a long period of time.</p>

<p><strong><em>Practical Guidance</em></strong></p>

<p>You will first find what habitats are in your study area, both in the <em>coastal regions</em> and <em>offshore</em>. In the global assessments, data were available for mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass beds, salt marshes, sea ice, or subtidal soft-bottom habitats, but there are likely other important habitats in your region.</p>

<p>Once you determine what habitats are in your area, you will need information about <em>the area extent of each habitat</em> within each region of your study area. You should consider whether and how far they go offshore and inland. Spatial data are preferred: you will be able to calculate the total square kilometers of each habitat within each region. For example, in global assessments mangrove area within 1 kilometer of the coastline were included, but this distance could change in OHI+ assessments.</p>

<p>You will need to include area and condition data specific to your study area and not rely on the global data provided. This is because the habitat data provided for your assessment are either over-representative by allocating the study area’s data equally to each subcountry region, or can be misrepresentative by allocating a proportion of those data to each subcountry region (based on the offshore area of each region to the total area). Either case assumes that if a habitat was present in the country, it could be found anywhere (which is not the case with study areas that span many degrees of latitude), and the first case inflates the habitat coverage in the study area.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TIP 1: Do you have maps that show current habitat distributions and maps that show historical habitat distributions? If so, you could extract that data for each of your regions to get a current and reference area. In the U.S. West Coast assessment (2014), researchers went to the local public library to find hand-drawn maps of historical salt marsh and sand dune extents in California. You could also use summarized habitat data that exists in tables or are already compiled in another source.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>TIP 2:  If local data are not available, you obtain certain habitat extent data from the global assessment, which used high resolution spatial extend data from this study:
_Hamilton, S. &amp; Casey, D. (2014). Creation of a high spatiotemporal resolution global database of continuous mangrove forest cover for the 21st Century (CGMFC-21): a big-data fusion approach. <a href="http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1412/1412.0722.pdf" target="_blank">arXiv:1412.0722</a>.
Good data to obtain from this study include shoreline, mangrove, soft bottom, and sea ice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>condition</em> of the habitats can be measured in different ways, depending on the data available. Indicators of condition could include habitat density, susceptibility to pathogens, or change in species composition or growth rates from impacts such as overgrazing. Look for studies assessing habitat integrity or condition specifically in your area.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In global assessments, direct information about coral condition was not available so it was based on the percentage of “living cover” on a coral reef relative to the potential range of the reef. In other words, estimates of coral cover within transects of certain sites were repeated in time and we used that rate of change in time as an indication of health of the reefs in the whole region. The difficulty lies in 1) having enough different locations sampled that you can say something about the whole region and 2) finding studies that did repeated measures in time, in the same location, over at least 20 years. In the Global 2013 assessment, there were so few datasets that satisfied this condition that we had to pool observations from different locations. Mean predicted values for each region from 1985-1987 were set as reference points.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If possible, you will want to gather habitat area and condition data through time so that you can calculate the <strong>trend</strong>. Ideally, there will be enough years of data to directly calculate the recent change in habitat condition as the trend. This isn’t always the case, and proxies or estimates might need to be used. For example, due to spotty salt marsh data we created trend categories of increasing (0.5), stable (0), and decreasing (-0.5) based on available data.</p>

<p>The <strong>reference point</strong> will likely be based on historic habitat area coverage and condition, with the assumption that habitat destruction has been and still is occurring and the target is to return to some point in the past. You will need historical data for this, from satellites, published papers, or even hand-drawn maps. The challenge is to find a reference point that is both <em>ambitious</em> and <em>realistic</em> (based on the S.M.A.R.T. principles: see <em>Conceptual Guide</em>), using the data available. If data allow, it will be possible to set a reference point that is more ambitious than that used in global assessments.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the reference point could be guided by a policy target. For example, are there any climate change policies in your area, with defined targets and objectives? Are there any restoration or carbon storage projects in your area? Do any organizations offer guidance on the amount of carbon storage your management policies should be aiming for?</p>

	<h3>Clean Waters</h3>
</hgroup>

<h3 id="clean-waters">Clean Waters</h3>

<p>People value marine waters that are free of pollution and debris for aesthetic and health reasons. Contamination of waters comes from oil spills, chemicals, eutrophication, algal blooms, disease pathogens (e.g., fecal coliform, viruses, and parasites from sewage outflow), floating trash, and mass kills of organisms due to pollution. People are sensitive to these phenomena occurring in areas that they access for recreation or other purposes as well as for simply knowing that clean waters exist. The Clean Water goal captures <strong>the degree to which local waters are unpolluted by natural and human-made causes</strong>. This goal scores highest when the contamination level is zero.</p>

<p><strong><em>Ideal Approach</em></strong></p>

<p>Ideally, data would be available and combined from different categories of marine pollution that can directly cause waters to become unsuitable for recreation, enjoyment, and other purposes. These factors typically include eutrophication (nutrients), chemicals, pathogens, oil pollution, and marine debris. The Status of these components is the inverse of their intensity (i.e., high input is a bad status).</p>

<p><strong><em>Practical Guidance</em></strong></p>

<p>First think about what kind of point and non-point sources of pollution are in your area. Are there known sources of trash and marine debris? Is there a population that does not have access to sanitation? Does your wastewater get effectively treated before it is discharged into the environment? How does urban runoff contribute to your local coastal waters? Where possible, you should think about categories of inputs that are not used in the Global Assessments. These include information on toxic algal blooms, oil spills, turbidity or sediment input, and floating trash, and think about how they can fit in to the model areas.</p>

<!-- | Input | Related data |
|-----|----------|
| Nutrients | Modeled plumes from land-based nitrogen inputs, fertilizer usage, algal blooms, eutrophication |
| Pathogens | Access to sanitation, population density, wastewater treatment |
| Chemicals | Organic pesticides, inorganic pesticides, toxic chemicals, chemicals from shipping, urban runoff |
| Trash | Floating trash, plastic inputs, uncollected waste |
| Other | Turbidity, altered sedimentation | -->

<p>Once you identify the sources, you should try to find <em>in situ</em> measurements of contamination. This could include monitoring data for pathogen levels, chemical contaminants, or data on the frequency and location of anoxic conditions or eutrophication. If direct measurements of water pollution are unavailable, indirect indicators, or proxy data, could be used. For example, land-based nutrients pollution is a proxy measure to nutrient input. The number of people who do not have improved access to sanitation could indicate the level of pathogen pollution.</p>

<p>If you don’t have such information, or have partial information on one of these inputs, you could combine it with population data or model the data to estimate how much of an impact it has on coastal areas. Do you have population density information over time? You could then use this later to calculate the trend.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the 2012 Global Assessment, these data layers are scores spatially for 3 nm out from shore. This is because it concentrates the effect of the inputs to coastal regions and makes them visible to the shoreline. You can change this value in your spatial analysis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should use more refined data than the Global Assessment data, because they rely heavily on proxy data for water quality. However, you should follow the same approach of the <em>geometric mean</em> to sum up the data layers that you find. This guarantees that if any one of the components scores poorly, the higher scores from other components will note hide the effect.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Clean Waters goal is connected to the <strong>Pressures</strong> layers. You should approach the both of them at the same time where possible. (See the sections on <strong>Pressures and Resilience</strong> to understand more.)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the Global Assessment, marine debris from plastic pollution is one of the pressures layers. The same data are also used in the <strong>Clean Waters</strong> goal, but they are inverted such that a low value of debris is a high score in the goal. This is commonly done for these interchangeable data layers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For each contamination category, a reference point is set and all data in this category is scaled to 1. The type of <strong>reference point</strong> used will depend on the data available. You may decided that an ocean completely rid of pollution is ideal, or you may find that beach closure of less than 10 days per year due to <em>E.coli</em> contamination is acceptable.</p>

<p><strong><em>Examples of the Approach</em></strong></p>

      <td>The goal model and reference point were the same as Global 2012. Data used to model the components for eutrophication (nutrients) and chemicals was the same as in Global 2012, while pathogens and debris were localized to state level data.</td>
      <td>The reference point approach was the same as Global 2012.</td>

      <td>The reference point was set as the number of days when beaches were closed to bathers because pathogen counts were higher than state standards.</td>

      <td><strong>China (2015)</strong></td>
      <td>Status model is similar to global assessments. Pollution is based on nitrogen, phosphate, chemical oxygen demand, and oil pollution.</td>
      <td>The same reference point as Global 2012 was used that waters are free from all pollution.</td>
      <td>The study used all local data. Data on pathogens and marine debris are poor or unavailable and thus were ignored in the model.</td>
