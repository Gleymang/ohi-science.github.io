The **OHI+ Community Forum** is a place to share questions and answers during the Conduct Phase of the OHI+ process. It is a venue to connect directly with other groups conducting OHI+ assessments listed on the [Projects](/projects) page. The [OHI Assessment Manual](/manual) contains instruction on experiences from OHI and OHI+ assessments, and will be frequently updated based on questions and answers posted here.

**To post on the Forum**, add an issue <a href="https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-science.github.io/issues" target="_blank">here</a>. You must have a GitHub username and permission to an OHI+ assessment repository.
