## [Data](/resources/data)

Global Ocean Health Index assessments require synthesizing highly heterogeneous information from nearly one hundred sources. We process data from each source to calculate OHI scores using freely available coding and version control software. 

Access data and code on the [Data](/resources/data) page.


## [Publications](/resources/publications)

We have published peer-reviewed manuscripts about Ocean Health Index methods, global assessments, assessments at other spatial scales, and best practices for leading assessments. 

Read peer-reviewed manuscripts and reports on the [Publications](/resources/publications) page.

## [Training](/resources/training)

OHI assessments use the OHI Toolbox, which is built and used with freely available coding and version control software. We teach open and reproducible practices through the OHI Toolbox and Manual, and are developing a more formal training program. 

Learn more about [OHI Goals](/goals), access the [OHI Manual](/manual), or see all of our materials on the [Training](/resources/training) page.

The Forum is a place to share questions, ideas, and solutions about OHI assessments. It is a venue to connect directly with other groups leading OHI+ assessments
