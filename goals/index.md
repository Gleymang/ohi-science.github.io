#### Ocean benefits delivered to humans now and in the future.

The Ocean Health Index defines a healthy ocean to be one that sustainably delivers a range of benefits to people now and in the future. **Ocean benefits delivered to humans are called *goals* within the OHI framework**, and are widely recognized for supporting human well-being and sustainable ocean ecosystems.  

The OHI framework can be used to assess ocean health in many different contexts (see examples on the [Projects](/projects) and [Publications](/resources/publications) pages). The goals included in any OHI assessment will depend on the context such that OHI scores represent the goals that are relevant to the assessment area. 

**Global OHI assessments categorized and scored ten goals and eight sub-goals representing ocean-derived benefits to people**. These goals and sub-goals are listed below, along with the philosophy of the goal, an 'ideal' approach to how it would be represented, practical guidance for modelling, and examples from completed assessments.
