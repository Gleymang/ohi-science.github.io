Global OHI assessments categorized and scored ten goals and eight sub-goals representing ocean-derived benefits to people. Most of the goals and sub-goals scored in global assessments will be relevant for OHI+ assessments, although it is important to critically evaluate this in each context. Once it is clear which goals should be assessed, it is important to develop a blueprint of how they would ideally be represented with models based on the knowledge the local system. These models will ultimately be developed with the information available and will likely differ from the ideal, but it is important to make the blueprint to highlight the intent of the goals and help identify the gaps in knowledge and information.

To help inform this process, below is information for each goal and sub-goal included in the global assessments. Along with the philosophy and how 'ideally' they might be modeled are descriptions of the approaches from completed assessments.
